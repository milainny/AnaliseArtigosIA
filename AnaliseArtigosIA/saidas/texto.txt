Abstract
Purpose – This paper aims to provide an assessment of the growth in marketing contracts in the US
pork industry as an efficient means to control pork quality and reduce transaction costs.
Design/methodology/approach – Information collected from pork quality and safety summits
sponsored by the National Pork Producers Council in cooperation with the National Pork Board,
published surveys of large packers related to contract use, and 15 contracts submitted by producers to
the Iowa Attorney General’s Office from 1996 to 2001 were examined. The theoretical framework used
combines branches of the industrial organization literature.
Findings – The paper provides information documenting the growing importance of addressing
pork quality problems in the 1990s and how marketing contracts between packers and producers can
help address these problems. Recognizes their role in reducing transaction costs associated with
carcass pricing programs, reducing pork quality measuring costs, providing quality control, and
reducing costs of adapting to quality uncertainty.
Research limitations/implications – The list of contracts examined is a small collection of
contracts voluntarily submitted by producers, and pertains to a specific geographic section of the USA.
Thus, they may not be representative of the entire industry.
Practical implications – The paper provides background information on quality issues faced by
the US pork industry and a framework for better understanding the potential role of marketing
contracts in addressing these issues.
Originality/value – This paper provides rather unique institutional background information on
important changes occurring in the US pork industry in the 1990s and the role of the growth in
marketing contracts in addressing related pork quality issues over time. Given the proprietary nature
of specific contract terms, a small sample of long-term marketing contracts is analyzed to better
understand contract design.

Introduction
In the US pork industry, the pace of recent organizational changes has been especially
dramatic. Contracting between pork packers and producers has increased considerably
in the 1990s, which resulted in fewer hog sales on the spot market. Marketing contracts
offered by pork processing companies typically specify the quantity of slaughter hogs
to be purchased on specified dates and places. Marketing contracts provide hog
producers a secure outlet for their hogs and specific pricing terms. Producers are

explicitly compensated for hog carcass weight and leanness. These arrangements
accounted for approximately 69 percent of hogs sold in 2004, compared to 11 percent in
1993, and less than 2 percent in 1980 (Grimes and Plain, 2009; Hayenga et al., 1996;
Marion, 1985).
The rapid increase in marketing contracts has been a concern of policymakers. As
marketing contracts replace hog sales on the spot market, spot prices are based on
fewer sales. Consequently, these markets may become highly volatile, subject to
manipulation, and less representative of a competitive market equilibrium. This may
lead to misallocated resources and lower social welfare because marketing contract
prices are typically tied to a spot price. Moreover, smaller independent producers
complain that packers prefer to contract only with larger producers and price
premiums paid are not made publicly available. In response to producer concerns
about price transparency, beginning in April 2001, the US Department of Agriculture
(USDA) implemented the Livestock Mandatory Price Reporting Program to provide all
segments of the livestock and meat industries with information on which to base
market decisions.
On the other hand, survey evidence suggests that long-term marketing agreements
play an important role in addressing pork quality problems. For example, Lawrence
et al. (2001) surveyed 11 of the largest US pork packers, representing 77 percent of total
hog slaughter, to determine the reasons for entering into formal marketing agreements.
Primary reasons included: to obtain a consistent supply of high quality hogs, to obtain
higher quality hogs, and to improve food safety. Market intervention policies that
restrict changes in the organization of pork markets could reduce social welfare if these
changes are efficient responses to the marketing environment. This case study
explores how the shift to marketing contracts could facilitate pork quality
improvements in the US pork industry using a small sample of hog marketing
contracts from 1996 to 2001.
Marketing contracts and product quality
Marketing contracts can facilitate improvements in product quality in several ways.
First, they can reduce measurement, or information, costs, which include costs of
searching for information about buyers or sellers in the market, inspecting goods prior
to purchase, and assigning a price (Hallwood, 1990; Hobbs, 1996). Measuring costs may
be especially significant when transactions are heterogeneous (e.g., vary in premiums
placed on quality characteristics across transactions and over time), or characterized
by asymmetric information (Lafontaine and Masten, 2002; Williamson, 1985). Two
types of asymmetric information can be distinguished. The seller may have more
information than the buyer about a difficult-to-measure quality attribute, or an
individual’s contribution to the quality outcome cannot be determined by measuring
the finished product. Marketing contracts may reduce costs that are associated with
assuring a closer correspondence between product value and price, or actions and
rewards (Barzel, 1982; Williamson, 1985).
Measuring difficulties associated with overcoming asymmetric quality information
may also be viewed as an “exchange hazard” (Williamson, 2000; Poppo and Zenger,
2002). When hog quality attributes are difficult to measure the producer may engage in
opportunistic behavior to exploit private information by failing to perform as agreed,
such as shirking or cutting corners on quality, also referred to as moral hazard. This is

expected to lead to contracts with added security features to mitigate the hazard, such
as provisions for third party monitoring of sellers, documents to justify activities
performed, and other means of increasing information disclosure.
Second, marketing contracts can facilitate adaptations to uncertainties in the
marketplace (Masten, 1996; Ryall and Sampson, 2003). Matching producers’ hogs to the
quality needs of packers may require continual revision in light of changing customer
demands and quality standards. As market uncertainty increases, it becomes more
costly to write enforceable, complete contracts that detail behavior contingent on future
outcomes. This leaves opportunities for parties to engage in opportunistic behavior to
avoid compliance or increases the likelihood that parties will fail to optimally adapt to
changing conditions. Consequently, contracts are likely to become more “relational” in
nature. That is, rather than laying out detailed terms of cooperation, contracts are
likely to specify the process by which terms will be established. By making contract
terms less explicit, transaction costs associated with renegotiating and revising
contract terms are reduced in light of uncertain future demand and quality needs.
Third, in cases where the packer is unaware of actions by the producer, two options
are available to limit moral hazard (Eisenhardt, 1989). Contracts may reward producers
based, at least partially, on outcomes of their behavior (outcome-oriented contract), or
the packer may invest in information about producer behavior (behavior-oriented
contract). The optimal performance evaluation strategy (behavior-oriented versus
outcome-oriented) will depend on the ability to measure quality outcomes and related
inputs. When quality outcomes are difficult to measure or difficult to measure in a
reasonable amount of time, behavior-oriented contracts will become more attractive.
Behavior-based contracts are more likely if producer activities can be easily defined
and evaluated, or the production process is highly task programmable, which makes it
easier to specify appropriate producer behavior in advance (Eisenhardt, 1989).
When producers are involved in several valuable activities that affect multiple,
important quality attributes, and the measurability of these attributes vary, explicit
incentives for those that are easily measured will be reduced (Holmstrom and Milgrom,
1991). This is because compensation based solely on a measurable outcome, such as
volume supplied, may lead to poor performance in an immeasurable outcome, such as
some dimension of pork quality. Similarly, explicit incentives for an individual
producer’s contribution to an easily assessed activity would lead the producer to
neglect other team production activities. The presence of incentive clauses for easily
measured quality outcomes will be influenced by the ability to identify producer
activities that affect the immeasurable attributes.
Increasing emphasis on pork quality
Pork quality is the characteristics that make meat desirable. For consumers, quality
may be determined by aesthetics (taste, smell, texture, color); nutrition (vitamins,
proteins, minerals, energy, type and proportion of fat); safety (absence of pathogens,
toxins); intangible qualities (organic, meat produced under high standards of animal
welfare); and characteristics such as convenience and reliability. Pork processors
identify several other determinants of pork quality: low “drip loss,” or fluid lost from
fresh, uncooked pork; color and color consistency; limited external fat; and absence of
defects (Morgan et al., 1994).

In the 1990s, several developments moved pork quality concerns to the forefront in
the USA. Renewed emphasis on leanness emerged in the decade of the 1980s with
human health research reports linking fat and cholesterol to cardiovascular disease in
people (Robenstein and Thurman, 1996). Although live hog grading proved to be
effective in encouraging farmers to reduce the fat content of their hogs, progress
slowed in the late 1980s, while health conscious consumers were apparently willing to
pay for even less fat (Kenyon and Purcell, 1999; Hayenga et al., 1985).
In 1992, several of the largest pork packing companies adopted a new carcass
measurement technology, referred to as the Fat-O-Meater. The technology is an optical
probe, used to distinguish backfat from lean tissue, combined with a scale and linked to
a computer. Backfat thickness and loin muscle depth, combined with the carcass
weight, are used to calculate the estimated percent carcass lean.
The detailed measurements and computing capability allowed packers to introduce
their own “pricing grids”: a schedule of price adjustments to a base price that depend
on carcass weight and percent lean. Carcass pricing grids, also referred to as carcass
merit programs or carcass value pricing programs, which provide more precise
measures of leanness suggest a higher expected price and stronger incentives for
producing leaner hogs. Evidence collected from six large meat packers in the Southeast
showed that carcass pricing grids were providing significant incentives for producers
to raise larger, leaner, and more-muscled hogs (Kenyon et al., 1995).
The pork industry experienced significant growth in carcass pricing programs in
the 1990s. As reported by USDA, the percentage of hogs purchased by packers based
on carcass evaluation increased from 11 percent in 1990, to 25 percent in 1993, and to
72 percent in 2001. By 2007, hogs purchased on a carcass basis reached 79 percent of
total hog slaughter. As the popularity of carcass pricing programs grew, leaner and
more muscular hogs became available at heavier, more desirable weights (Table I).
According to Meisinger (2000), more progress was made in the 1990s to reduce carcass
fat and increase muscling than in the previous four decades combined.
Pale, soft, exudative pork
As renewed emphasis was placed on producing lean, well muscled hogs in the 1990s,
pork quality continued to change in other ways. In particular, a relatively high
incidence of “pale, soft, exudative” (PSE) pork became more apparent. PSE is a fresh
pork classification category defined by very light color, soft texture (or lack of
firmness), and exudative or exhibiting a high degree of drip-loss after slaughter. These
attributes were found to be associated with the Porcine Stress Syndrome (PSS) gene (or
stress gene), which was carried by some of the leaner genetic lines (Smith, 1999). Hence,
as hogs became leaner and more heavily muscled, they were also more susceptible to
producing pork with the PSE condition.

PSE pork quickly became recognized for its undesirable qualities (Kaufman et al.,
1994). Economic losses associated with PSE included reduced yield during processing
and cooking, drip loss in retail display trays, reduced shelf life, increased quality
variation, and reduced consumer appeal. Panel scores suggest that pale-colored pork is
less acceptable to consumers (McKeith et al., 1996). PSE pork is also less tender because
of increased cooking losses.
At the same time, as packers attempted to differentiate their products through
branding programs, pork quality standards and consistency became increasingly
important. In Lawrence et al.’s (2001) survey of 11 large US pork packers, the packers
reported a need for increased quality control and consistency in response to greater
demand from their pork customers and ultimate consumers. The survey also found
that branded programs by packers have been rapidly increasing, accounting for 18
percent of 1999 sales volume, and were expected to represent an even larger share by
2004. In the eight-year period from 1996 to 2003, over three times as many branded
fresh pork products were introduced compared to the previous eight years
(Datamonitor, 2003).
Meat safety
Another development that raised quality awareness was a spate of meat safety recalls
by food companies in the 1990s. These events heightened media attention and
consumer awareness of the importance of containing microbial hazards (Shane, 1999).
On the heels of the Jack-in-the-Box beef recall in 1993, new regulatory initiatives in the
meat and poultry industries were designed to replace the “poke and sniff” inspection
methods for detecting tainted meat. In 1996, the USDA, Food Safety and Inspection
Service published the final pathogen reduction regulation for the meat and poultry
industry (Unnevehr et al., 1998). It set standards for reducing of microbial pathogens on
meat and poultry products and required meat and poultry plants to implement Hazard
Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) plans.
HACCP is a preventative approach to controlling biological, physical, and chemical
food safety hazards. As part of the HACCP program, companies identify the types of
hazards that could affect their products, institute controls to prevent or minimize the
hazards, monitor results of these controls, and maintain records of monitoring efforts.
In the event that problems are found, the packer is required to take corrective action by
locating and eliminating the cause and establishing preventative measures. The
government oversees the process and verifies its adequacy. In effect, HACCP shifted
more responsibility for safety from the government to meat packers. Mandated use of
HACCP reflected the growing importance of preventing and controlling safety
problems before products reach the consumer (Unnevehr, 2003).
Pork exports
The US pork industry experienced unprecedented growth in exports in the 1990s,
increasing from 1.6 percent of production in 1990 to 8.6 percent in 2003. The North
American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the Uruguay Round of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) opened previously protected markets.
Technological advances allowed US exporters to ship chilled pork products to Japan,
which is the largest US export market. In March 1997, Taiwan was forced to close

down its pork industry due to an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease, which opened the
door for other exporters.
Pork product quality and customized service were major factors affecting global
trade of pork products. Consequently, as US pork export markets fueled new business
opportunities, addressing pork quality problems became more important. For example,
in the 1990s, the USA made significant progress toward overtaking Denmark (a major
US export competitor) as the leading exporter to Japan, where meat quality issues are
especially important. A 1990 survey of Japanese consumers regarding factors that
affect selection of pork products found that food safety, fat intake, taste, and freshness
were among the quality characteristics that ranked high (Sapp and Knipe, 1990).
Marketing contracts and carcass pricing programs
As advances in measurement technology enabled more accurate and less expensive
measures of carcass leanness, packers could offer grids with narrower groupings for
leanness and carcass weight. In addition to added packer costs related to
record-keeping and maintaining producer identity (McCoy and Sarhan, 1988),
carcass grading programs with more narrow quality groupings likely increase costs of
sorting and pricing hogs.
The move to carcass pricing programs also likely raised producer costs associated
with comparing alternative packer pricing programs for several reasons. First, each
meat packer has different premium and discount schedules, depending on the type of
outlet and products sold. For example, packers such as Hormel, who process much of
their pork, prefer a lighter carcass. Others, such as Excel, prefer a heavier carcass for
boned or boxed products. Marbery (2000a) writes that restaurants prefer relatively
small loins, which come from 215-230 pound hogs compared with the standard
270-pound hog. A packer that exports to Japan prefers leaner pork.
Second, instruments used to measure lean vary across packers. In 2000, among the
nation’s 32 largest plants owned by 13 packers, seven of these packers used the
Fat-O-Meater, which employs light diffraction to measure fat and loin depth. Ultrafom
and Animal Ultrasound Systems (AUS), which measure fat depth and loin depth by
ultrasound rather than light diffraction, are used by three companies. Two packers
used a low technology ruler measurement on midline backfat to estimate lean. A more
sophisticated measuring device, AutoFom, also uses ultrasound but scans carcasses at
2,000 points and monitors intramuscular fat, and pH and color (PSE pork indicators) in
the cooler. This device was used by Hatfield and became operational in one of Hormel’s
plants in 2000. These differences led to significant grading program disparities across
packers.
A third factor complicating price comparisons across packers is that carcass merit
matrices may be revised by the packer, which suggests the producers must continually
reevaluate alternative packer buying programs. Buying programs have been
continually adjusted to increase compensation for leaner hogs, and packers have
been narrowing their ideal carcass weight ranges to provide more consistent products.
Packer resistance toward making these programs public also complicated producers’
ability to evaluate alternative programs[1].
Along with the growing importance of carcass pricing grids, marketing contracts
between packers and producers quickly supplanted much of the spot market trade. The
dominant pricing method in these contracts was a formula price adjusted by the

packer’s carcass pricing grid, with a current live spot market price (e.g., Iowa-Southern
Minnesota plant prices) serving as the base price (Lawrence et al., 1997; Hayenga et al.,
1996).
Given changes in the pricing system, two features of marketing contracts could
lower packer and producer measuring costs compared to spot markets. First, long-term
agreements may reduce search costs associated with finding suitable trading partners.
The duration of most hog marketing contracts is four to seven years (Kenyon and
Purcell, 1999), which can reduce producers’ costs associated with reevaluating packer
grids at each sales interval. Similarly, packer costs associated with identifying suitable
producers are incurred at long-term intervals.
Second, minimum quantity requirements help to assure packers that hogs are of
uniform quality, which allows packers to engage in much less testing at the time of
exchange. A 1994 survey of the largest US pork packers revealed that almost half of
the 13 packers involved in formal, written contracts had minimum volume
requirements, and either minimum quality requirements or breeding/genetic
stipulations (Hayenga et al., 1996). Large numbers of hogs produced under similar
breeding, nutrition, health, and other production conditions would give the packer
useful information on the other hogs by measuring a few. Also, because much of the
difference in the typical versus ideal hog is related to genetics (Kenyon et al., 1995),
stipulations regarding genetics provide further assurances of uniform quality. Genetic
traits that directly effect meat quality include intra-muscular fat (that is, marbling),
meat color, pH, and tenderness.
Contract design to control quality and limit measuring costs
While carcass pricing grids provided strong incentives for leanness, the growing
prevalence of PSE-related characteristics and safety concerns were expected to lead to
efforts to control these attributes as well. However, measuring costs associated with
these attributes provided obstacles to compensating producers. Packers could not
readily grade hogs using PSE indicators (for example pH, color, and water holding
capacity) because they are difficult to apply in high-speed slaughter lines that kill 1000
hogs per hour (3 seconds per carcass) (Marbery, 2000b). In 2000, Forrest et al. (2000)
noted that predicting color and water holding capacity of pork is one of the most
difficult and important challenges facing meat scientists.
Biological (bacteria, viruses, etc.) and chemical (antibiotics, hormones, etc.)
contaminants also presented measurement difficulties. Testing for pathogen content at
different stages of the supply chain is often difficult because rapid tests are not
available (Unnevehr and Jensen, 2001). Microbiological and chemical residue testing is
of limited value because the time required to obtain results does not permit action to be
taken while the meat is being processed.
While PSE and safety attributes presented measuring difficulties, relationships
between these attributes and production activities became better known. Research
improved knowledge about the link between PSE problems and hog production inputs
(Smith, 1999). Producers are responsible for 50 percent of PSE problems, mostly
through their choice of genetics. As hogs were bred to be lean and well-muscled, such
breeding led to more stress-prone hogs. Producers can reduce hog stress in several
ways, including minimizing the use of electric prods, designing finishing facilities to
optimize environmental conditions, and using feed additives.

While less is known about the application of specific on-farm HACCP principles to
control pathogen contaminants, such as salmonella, producers directly affect pork
safety through health management and handling practices. The most significant way
that producers implement HACCP principles is through the PORK QUALITY
ASSURANCEe (PQA) certification program (Lautner, 1999), which is a voluntary
education program introduced in 1989 to prevent antimicrobial residues and enhance
herd health practices. To blend with packer HACCP plans, the National Pork Producers
Council released a new version of the PQA program in 1997, which was designed to
more clearly define producers’ responsibilities. At the time, PQA Level III was the
highest level of the PQA program, and could only be completed after discussions with
a third-party verifier (veterinarians, agricultural education instructors, USDA
extension personnel).
Contract sample
Given the strong link between production inputs and PSE pork, and certain safety
attributes, contracts are expected to specify input requirements and monitoring of
production activities[2]. A survey of 13 large US packers provides a glimpse of specific
non-price terms of long-term hog marketing contracts in 1993 (Hayenga et al., 1996). In
addition to minimum quality requirements or breeding/genetic specifications required
by nearly half of the packers, feeding programs or approval of facilities were specified
by three packers. However, herd health or drug withdrawal programs were included by
only one packer.
A more recent snapshot of marketing contracts is provided by a sample of 15
marketing contracts submitted by producers to the Iowa Attorney General’s Office.
These contracts were offered from 1996 to 2001 by six leading packers at the time
(Farmland, Hormel, IBP, John Morrell, Swift, Excel) (Table II). Frequency of contract
clauses related to monitoring and input specifications are summarized in Table III.

Several clauses relate to food safety. In stark contrast to the earlier 1993 survey, nearly
all packers had provisions that required producers to be certified at Level III PQA or
higher. Over half of the contracts required producers to be supervised by a licensed
veterinarian. Five contracts offered by three packers had provisions that require
producers to comply with any company HACCP programs in place.
While five contracts have specific clauses with minimum PSE standards, they are
not likely to involve regular measurements with consistent feedback to producers. For
example, in Swift’s 1998 contract, there is no indication of how the PSE condition
would be measured or procedures for verifying compliance. Aside from lean
composition and trim losses, there are no other pork quality data provided by any
packer back to the producer on a consistent basis (Meisinger, 2000). Instead, PSE
requirements may serve as a communication device to express PSE concerns to the
producer, and perhaps signal to customers packer efforts to improve quality.
Given difficulties in measuring PSE pork, strong incentives for leanness provided by
carcass pricing grids might be expected to divert producer effort away from controlling
PSE pork. Clearly, the packer’s ability to control PSE pork is enhanced by its relationship
to genetics and other hog production inputs. Input specifications, together with packer
monitoring, can give packers some control over PSE-related attributes.
Nearly all of the 15 contracts contain terms related to inputs that affect PSE. Six
contracts had clauses requiring company approval (or joint agreement) of genetics or
feeder-pig source. Four other contracts required a specific type of genetics or source of
feeder pigs. In five contracts, producers were required to handle hogs in a humane
manner or in a way that optimizes meat quality. Most contracts also required
producers to use company-approved or company-specific feeding programs, and five
contracts have clauses requiring company-approved facilities.

Are strong incentives for leanness efficient?
As discussed earlier, increasingly leaner, heavily muscled hogs were often carriers of
the stress gene, which was linked to PSE pork. Strong incentives for leanness provided
by carcass pricing grids are expected when the packer can use marketing contracts to
specify and monitor producer behavior related to other important, but difficult to
measure attributes. Given the ability to control the PSE attribute through genetics and
production management practices, this is clearly the case.
Strong incentives for leaner hogs are also efficient when marginal benefits to the
packer are relatively large compared to marginal benefits from reductions in PSE pork
(Holmstrom and Milgrom, 1991). Marginal benefits from producer efforts to control
PSE attributes may have been limited by industry wide efforts to breed out the stress
syndrome from commercial herds (Casau, 2003; Marbery, 2000b).
As marginal benefits from increasing leanness become relatively smaller compared
with controlling PSE attributes, weaker incentives, or perhaps disincentives, for leaner
hogs are expected (Holmstrom and Milgrom, 1991). There is a positive relationship
between increasingly lean hogs and PSE pork (which is disliked by
packers/processors, distributors, and consumers). In addition, some researchers
believe that fresh pork may have become too lean for consumers (Marbery, 2000c).
Excessive leanness was one weakness identified in a 2002 pork quality audit of US
packers accounting for 64 percent of hogs slaughtered (Messenger, 2004a)[3].
Disincentives for lean hogs was reflected in at least one carcass pricing grid recently
submitted by a packer to the USDA’s swine contract library[4]. The grid demonstrated
a slight cutoff in lean premiums for hogs exceeding 58.9 lean percent in the industry’s
most common weight range, 232 to 292 pounds.
Marketing contracts and adjustments to uncertainty
Many contract clauses related to production input requirements tend to be less detailed
regarding the degree to which required inputs and expected outputs are fully specified.
Rather than specifically defining input standards, many clauses require
packer-approval of feeding programs, facilities, or genetics. In Excel’s contract, for
example, specifications regarding diet, management, facilities, and handling of hogs
require that these inputs be company approved, meet industry standards, or minimize
carcass damage. Other provisions describe packer expectations or plans for working
together. As stated in one of Hormel’s contracts:
Both parties will work together to assure the genetics are meeting both the production and
carcass meat quality requirements.
The less detailed nature of these terms may reflect uncertainty in pork markets that
make it difficult for packers to accurately predict future input requirements. Adapting
to changing input requirements may be facilitated by recognizing potential areas of
conflict in advance, and defining partner expectations and a plan for collaboration,
rather than defining specific terms of cooperation. By leaving contract terms less
explicit, transaction costs associated with renegotiating and revising contract terms
are reduced in light of uncertain future needs.
Changing industry standards for pork products is one source of uncertainty in the
transaction. In addition to the growing importance of domestic fresh pork branding

programs, international markets are increasingly targeted as avenues for growth.
Quality standards are dictated by preferences of the importing country.
Changes in quality measuring tools are another source of uncertainty. More
accurate measures of pork quality can lead to corresponding adjustments in input
requirements and pricing programs. Examples from the late 1990s include IBP’s (now
Tyson Fresh Meat) adoption of the ultrasound system for measuring lean, and
Hormel’s Autofom carcass testing system, which also monitors PSE-related indicators.
Uncertainty related to output and input requirements is reflected in “adjustment
mechanisms” to alter the contract over time. For example, almost all contracts specify
that the packer can change the carcass pricing grid, some requiring advanced notice to
the producer. In its 2000 contract, John Morrell reserves the right to change or add
additional requirements, upon reasonable notice, consistent with evolving industry
standards for quality. Two of Swift’s contracts, require producers to modify nutrition
plans if requested (citing the use of non-genetically modified feed as an example). In
addition, if requested by the company, producers must implement programs that
improve quality or the company’s ability to sell products (citing HACCP as an
example). These terms help to resolve coordination problems and conflicts that might
otherwise develop.
Variation in sample contract provisions
Although there are many similarities in input requirements and monitoring clauses
across the sample, there are also significant differences, even between contracts offered
by the same packer. This may reflect differences in the type of outlet targeted. For
example, leanness, consistent color, and water holding capacity are more important for
pork destined for grocery store shelves and international markets compared to further
processing and food service outlets (Huskey, 2000).
Differences in contract terms may also reflect changes in information and packer
goals over time. Ten of the contracts offered by Hormel, Swift, and John Morrell allow
us to observe contract terms over time. Splitting the sample into two time periods,
1996-1998 and 1999-2001, provides five contracts for each period (Table IV).
Comparing frequency counts across periods, all three packers added clauses that
required producers to comply with any company HACCP program, perhaps in
anticipation of a farm-level HACCP program.
Clauses related to handling of hogs were introduced for the first time in the latter
period. This may reflect growing knowledge about the causes of PSE-related
attributes, and greater concerns over PSE pork in response to increasingly leaner and
stress-prone hogs. While progress had apparently been made in breeding out the stress
gene in the hog population, the 2002 pork quality audit revealed an increase in the
incidence of PSE pork compared to 1992. This suggests handling problems may have
been an important contributor to PSE-related problems[5].
Changes in contract terms over time also coincide with attempts by these packers to
expand their offerings of branded pork products. Using two five-year time periods,
corresponding to the break in our contract analysis, we compare the number of new
fresh pork products introduced by Hormel, John Morrell, and Swift. From 1999 to 2003,
the number of new products tracked by Datamonitor increased markedly compared to
the earlier period (Figure 1).

Conclusion
The US pork industry’s adoption of marketing contracts offer several advantages in light
of changing emphasis on pork quality attributes. The long-term nature of marketing
contracts limits the number of times that producers must evaluate alternative
heterogeneous packer grading programs. Minimum volume requirements allow packers
to obtain a larger number of uniform hogs from a single source, so that measuring a few
provides more reliable information about quality of the rest. A sample of contracts
collected in a specific region of the USA provides insight into the design of marketing
contracts. By specifying production input requirements in contracts, packers could
maintain strong incentives for the easily measured leanness attribute, while controlling
for other quality attributes that are more difficult to measure. When quality
specifications and production input requirements are subject to change, clauses in
long-term marketing contracts that define packer expectations and plans for
collaboration with producers facilitate adaptation to these changes. Coupled with
production monitoring provisions, these contract terms appear to support effective
coordination and timely responses to changing input requirements. While there may be
other factors that contributed to the growing use of pork marketing contracts, changing
emphasis on pork quality provided strong incentives for their increasing popularity.
Sorting out the relative importance of alternative market forces driving changes in
vertical coordination of the US pork industry provides rich ground for future research.
Notes
1. As part of the Livestock Mandatory Price Reporting Program, the USDA publishes
mandatory data on contract arrangements, among other data, while protecting the identity
of those reporting and the confidentiality of specific transactions.
2. Because packers do not typically own the hogs, provisions regarding production inputs are
likely related to hog quality outcomes rather than efficiency gains that lower production costs.
Furthermore, one may argue that input provisions have less to do with the leanness attribute
because of strong explicit incentives for lean in the carcass pricing program (Smith, 1999).
3. The study found that bacon from thin bellies, while visually appealing to consumers because
of less fat, is less palatable (Messenger, 2004b). It also causes processing problems related to
yield losses from slicing and cook shrink. As bacon-topped sandwiches became more
popular at restaurants, the belly became an increasingly valuable part of the hog.

by clicking on Swine or Pork Market Formula under National, and then clicking on
“Premiums and Discounts.”
5. Recent concerns over handling issues are reflected in the establishment of a Trucker Quality
Assurance (TQA) program by the National Pork Board in 2001. TQA is a certification
program that educates truckers about proper handling, loading, and transporting of pigs,
with emphasis on animal welfare and biosecurity topics (Miller, 2002). Recent research also
suggests that there may be other genetic causes of PSE pork, besides the stress gene (Casau
(2003); Pork, 2004). Hence, certain genotypes may be more prone to stress than previously
thought, which increases the importance of proper hog handling.
