Abstract
Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to describe the forms of coordinating transactions used by a
large beef slaughterhouse and processing companies and their suppliers of beef cattle, and to identify
the reasons for the adoption of plural forms of governance for their transactions with cattle suppliers.
Design/methodology/approach – A case study format was selected for this investigation. The
focal company selected offers a large number of products derived from beef for different
commercialisation channels in the domestic and foreign market. A non-probability sample of 30
suppliers (cattle farmers) of the focal company provided data on finished steers sold in 2010, according
to the three types of governance used in the transactions (spot market, forward contracts and
long-term contracts).
Findings – The simultaneous use of more than one type of governance structure to coordinate
similar transactions has been termed plural forms of governance in the literature. In Brazil, new forms
of governance, such as formal and informal contracts, have been adopted for transactions between beef
processing companies and cattle farmers, in addition to the use of spot market and vertical integration.
It has been shown that the adoption of plural forms reduces the risk of complex transactions; and is a
strategy to deal with unpredictable institutional environments and high heterogeneity of both
suppliers and distribution channels.
Research limitations/implications – The research provides empirical evidence of plural forms of
governance, as well as the reasons for the adoption of this strategy by firms, which contributes to the
ongoing theoretical discussion on this subject.
Practical implications – The paper has implications for company supply chain management.
Originality/value – This paper presents theoretical review on plural forms of governance, new
empirical evidence and determinant factors for their adoption.

2003). A new list of policies, laws and control systems has been adopted in an effort to
meet these new market demands. The agents of the supply chains, especially the rural
producers and processors, have reacted by changing production systems,
incorporating innovations and modifying market relations.
In the beef supply chain, it was necessary to introduce traceability mechanisms,
launch initiatives to standardise products, react more quickly to changes in
consumption habits, differentiate products and reduce seasonality in the supply of raw
material (Souza Filho et al., 2010). The beef industry in Brazil is no longer a traditional
supplier of beef carcass, as a commodity, and has transformed itself into a supplier of
specialised products, such as cuts with different quality requirements for a broader set
of distribution channels. In the domestic market, some commercialisation channels are
very demanding, such as boutique butchers and sophisticated restaurants, in which
quality is the determining factor in the customer’s decision to purchase. However, for
the majority of customers in the low-income bracket, who purchase beef in
supermarkets, butcher shops and open-air markets, price is much more important than
quality in determining the decision to purchase. The foreign market, although more
demanding in terms of quality, is also segmented. While the European Union (EU)
requires high quality control standards, including a traceability system, and pays a
higher price for this, other regions are less demanding in terms of control and demand
products with lower prices.
This new market configuration and the rising importance of Brazil in the
international beef market were followed by significant changes in market relations
between beef processing companies and cattle farmers. Closer ties between rural
producers and processing companies have been observed, formally through contracts
or informally, with the aim of raising the efficiency of the production systems and
reacting to these new circumstances (Vieira and Traill, 2008). In addition to the
traditional spot market, recent studies have identified the adoption of new forms of
governance, such as formal and informal contracts, for transactions between beef
processing companies and cattle farmers, as well as growth in vertical integration
(Zylbersztajn and Machado Filho, 2003; Caleman et al., 2008).
The adoption of new forms of governance for the transactions between beef
processing companies and farmers is related to the changes observed in the demand for
beef. However, one cannot ignore that the factors associated with beef cattle production
systems adopted in Brazil also play a role. In Brazil, various livestock production
systems coexist, for which different standards of technology and administration are
adopted, as well as different breeds of beef cattle. As a result, the supply of cattle for
the slaughterhouse units presents great diversity in terms of quality and standards.
Thus, a great deal of coordination is necessary to match the heterogeneity of the
consumer beef market with the heterogeneity of the supply sources for beef cattle. In
this context, the adoption of more than one governance structure by the beef industry
can be justified.
The simultaneous adoption of more than one type of governance structure by the
same company or within the same production chain to coordinate similar transactions
was classified in the literature as plural forms of governance (Bradach and Eccles,
1989). Studies have been carried out to analyse the adoption of plural forms and
identify their main determinants and potential advantages (Bradach, 1997; Mols, 2000;
Affuso, 2002; Zylbersztajn and Nogueira, 2002; Heide, 2003; Parmigiani, 2007; Silva

Mello and Paulillo, 2010; Schnaider and Saes, 2011; Menard, 2011; Brookes and Roper,
2012). According to the literature the main advantages of the use of plural forms are:
lower transaction costs (Mols, 2000; Affuso, 2002; Mello and Paulillo, 2010; Schnaider
and Saes, 2011); the potential synergies that the different forms of governance can
provide (Bradach and Eccles, 1989; Bradach, 1997; Brousseau and Codron, 1997;
Schnaider and Saes, 2011; Menard, 2011); better planning and control of production
capacity, supply and distribution, resulting in higher production efficiency (Parmigiani,
2007; Perrigot et al., 2009); more effective monitoring of external suppliers with a
resulting reduction in asymmetric information in the transactions (Mols, 2000; Heide,
2003; Menard, 2011); and greater flexibility for the firms to meet their needs (Brousseau
and Codron, 1997; Silva and Azevedo, 2007; Perrigot et al., 2009).
Against this backdrop, the main objective of the present work was to describe the
forms of coordinating transactions used by a large beef slaughterhouse and processing
company and its suppliers of beef cattle, as well as to identify the causes of different
governance strategies the firm is following. Section 2 presents a review of the literature
on plural forms of governance, allowing the identification of potential determinants
and advantages of this strategy. The methodology for empirical analysis is based on a
case study of a large Brazilian beef processing company, as presented in section 3. The
results are presented in section 4, followed by final remarks in section 5.
2. Plural forms of governance
The analysis carried out in this article employs the theoretical frameworks of New
Institutional Economics (NIE) and Transaction Costs Economics (TCE). NIE
challenges neoclassical microeconomic theory by contesting the automatic
functioning of the market solely through price mechanisms (Coase, 1937). According
to NIE, transactions occur in an institutional environment, which determines their rules
of operation. In this way, the objective of NIE is to identify which is the best form of
organisation for economic transactions, since different configurations change the rules
for resource allocation. TCE is based on the assumption that the issue of economic
organisation is, above all, a matter of governance. In this sense, it endeavours to
explain the different organisational forms that exist in the market and their contractual
arrangements, highlighting the institutional environment and its interaction with
organisations. According to TCE, there are different possible governance structures
and the agents must work to discover governance structures that enable lower
transaction costs. In a broader definition, transaction costs can be described as the
“costs of running the economic system” (Arrow, 1969, p. 48) or the “equivalent of
friction in physical systems” (Williamson, 1985, p. 19). There are ex ante and ex post
transaction costs. The first are the costs of drafting, negotiating, and safeguarding an
agreement, while the second are costs incurred when transactions drift out of
alignment.
Williamson (1985) identifies three basic forms of coordinating transactions, also
called governance structures:
(1) Spot market – adapted form of non-specific transaction, where there is no effort
made to repeat the relationship. In this format, the evaluation of the relationship
by the parties is based on experience. It is the case that best approximates the
neoclassical theoretical framework of pure competition.

(2) Hybrid forms – given the specificity of the assets and the recurrence of the
transactions, relationships of trust can be built. In this case, incentives sufficient
to bring the transaction between the agents into the firm (vertical integration)
were not found. Formal and informal contracts can be established, since the
agents are inclined to establish and comply with their clauses.
(3) Vertical integration or hierarchy – coordination necessary for regular
transactions and in the presence of highly specific assets. In this case, the
transactions between agents are brought into the hierarchy of the firm.
The emphasis placed by Williamson (1985) on the analysis of arrangements uncovered
hybrid structures, which lie somewhere between the market and the hierarchy. Me´nard
(2004) stressed the need to build a theory that explains these structures, in which the
agents are completely independent of each other, but work together in some type of
business. In arrangements of this type, the agents share technological knowledge,
capital, products or services, without, however, becoming a part of activities within a
single firm. The influence of price mechanisms is lower than in the spot market.
Regardless of its format, the coordination of activities is based on cooperation between
the parties and in the sharing of important decisions, such as investment decisions.
This union creates a culture that encourages the joint pursuit of better performance
and greater profitability for the whole. However, a poor distribution of tasks and gains
can easily generate conflict, which can destabilise the arrangement.
Various studies have used TCE with the aim of identifying existing governance
structures. In sectors focusing on the production of agri-food products, the emphasis
has been on agricultural food chains, allowing the identification of the three basic
forms, as defined by Williamson (1985). Although Williamson (1985) did not directly
touch on the the possibility of companies using more than one structure of governance
simultaneously, Bradach and Eccles (1989) found that this did in fact occur in the real
world. The authors have termed this as plural forms, in which “[. . .] distinct
organisational control mechanisms operate simultaneously for the same function by
the same firm.” (Bradach and Eccles, 1989, p. 112). Following them, many studies have
identified the coexistence of more than one form of governance within the same supply
chain to govern similar transactions (Bradach, 1997; Mols, 2000; Affuso, 2002;
Zylbersztajn and Nogueira, 2002; Heide, 2003; Parmigiani, 2007; Silva and Azevedo,
2007; Dant et al., 2008; Gellynck and Molna´r, 2009; Mello and Paulillo, 2010; Schnaider
and Saes, 2011; Menard, 2011; Brookes and Roper, 2012). Most of these studies address
the adoption of plural forms in downstream transactions. Few studies have sought to
identify the adoption of more than one form of governance in upstream transactions; as
did Heide (2003), on purchasing relationships between original equipment
manufacturers and component suppliers, and Parmigiani (2007) on sourcing model
decisions by manufacturing firms in the tooling industry. Also, a few of them have
adopted a single firm approach, as in section 4 of this article.
The literature that addresses the coexistence of various forms of governance in a
single market, or by a single firm, presents various explanations for the phenomena.
These explanations can be classified into three groups, which will be analysed below:
different features of the transactions; plural forms as a transitional situation; and stable
plural forms as a strategy to coordinate the transactions over time. According to the
authors of the first group, organisational forms can be plural, or in other words use

more than one type of governance structure, if the transactions are different,
distinguishing themselves in at least one of their classic features: specificity of assets,
uncertainty and frequency. This explanation for the use of plural forms is in line with
the model by Williamson (1991), which states that different mechanisms actually
govern different transactions in at least one feature. For Minkler and Park (1994), the
different levels of specificity of assets involved in the transactions established by the
firm are what justify the simultaneous presence of different governance mechanisms.
The theoretical framework proposed by Menard (2011) added the attribute ambiguity,
which arises out of a difficulty to analyse the specificity of the assets at the time the
transaction is conducted, and the complexity of the transactions in the analysis of the
adoption of plural forms. In this sense, Mols (2000), Heide (2003), Parmigiani (2007) and
Mello and Paulillo (2010) found empirical evidence that the adoption of plural forms is
explained by differences in transaction-specific investments, uncertainty and
transaction frequency.
The second and third group of authors use the same arguments as the first group to
justify the existence of plural forms. However, they add to the discussion on the
stability and advantages of plural forms. The author of the second group considers the
use of more than one form of governance as transitional, where one or another
governance structure should prevail as adjustments occur. Within the scope of the
agro-industrial systems, the issue of plural forms was addressed by Zylbersztajn and
Nogueira (2002), who assumed that the most efficient arrangement would be gradually
adopted by the agents, in other words, alternative types of governance could coexist as
points of disequilibrium in an adjustment process. For the authors, the plurality of
arrangements could be explained by: situations of disequilibrium, in which the
presence of plural forms could represent a situation of adjustment between the current
and future forms, driven by modifications in the features of the transactions; barriers to
the adoption of a new improved governance due to the existence of specific
non-transferrable routines; and effects of the institutional environment in which
governance occurs as an event generating multiple alignments.
The authors of the third group argue that plural forms are stable and are part of the
strategy for coordinating transactions by firms. The justification for this is found in the
complementarity of the mechanisms of governance (Bradach and Eccles, 1989;
Brousseau and Codron, 1997; Bradach, 1997; Heide, 2003; Parmigiani, 2007; Schnaider
and Saes, 2011; Menard, 2011). In other words, this stability in the mix of governances
occurs due to the possibility of exploring some synergy between complementary
mechanisms of governance. In this case, there are situations in which part of the
function of the contract would contribute to the efficiency of another contractual form,
revealing that, in addition to being alternatives, the mechanisms of coordination can be
complementary. The pioneering study by Bradach and Eccles (1989) posited that the
adoption of plural forms of governance is related to the use of one form of governance
to manage the other. For example, the companies can adopt vertical integration to
acquire knowledge about a production process of its raw material and, based on this
knowledge, begin to demand better results from their suppliers in terms of the quality
or price of the product supplied. Porter (1980) had already noted some of the
advantages that partially integrated companies obtain in relationships with their
suppliers on the spot market. Although the author did not expressly use the term plural
forms, he did perceive that by adopting more than one form of governance (vertical

integration and spot market) in upstream transactions, the companies were able to
exercise greater bargaining power in the purchase of raw materials from external
suppliers on the spot market. Brousseau and Codron (1997), upon analysing the supply
of fruit in French supermarkets, discovered that the coexistence of plural forms
promotes complementarity for the firm, allowing the distributor to: match price and
quality strategies; ensure flexibility to face uncertainties about the quantity and
quality of production; and enable the learning of a governance to be used in the
management of the other, resulting in a cross-learning effect.
According to the literature of TCE, transactions made purely on the spot market are
subject to the problems of adverse selection and moral hazard. Heide (2003) proposes
that a plural forms approach involves using a particular type of agent (i.e. an internal
one) to reduce the problems of information asymmetry (adverse selection and moral
hazard) in relation to another type of agent (i.e. the external one) due to the nature of the
information that becomes available through vertical integration or partnership
contracts. Information on the production and process technology used by suppliers
outside the company is not always visible, and can result in adverse selection. Moral
risk occurs when suppliers selected by the company act in an opportunistic manner,
altering, for example, the quality of the input pre-established between the parties. This
behaviour harms the competitiveness of the firm. The author, using primary data on
purchasing relationships between original equipment manufacturers and component
suppliers, and a logit model approach, found that the higher the asymmetry of
information present the transactions, the higher the chance that the companies would
use plural forms with their suppliers. In this case, plurality is understood to mean the
adoption of hierarchy to partially meet the supply needs of the companies. The
remainder of this supply would be met by a third party. The adoption of plural forms
enables a reduction of information asymmetry in the transactions with suppliers,
without having to internalise all production. By internalising part of production, the
firms are able to impose elements of a hierarchical transaction in their transactions in
the spot market, which, in turn, reduces the possibility of exposure to moral risk or
adverse selection in transactions (Heide, 2003).
Parmigiani (2007), when analysing sourcing model decisions from 193
manufacturing firms, found evidence that the adoption of plural forms is stable in
the long term. Using qualitative choice statistical models, the author identified that the
adoption of plural forms is determined by transaction attributes (asset specificity and
uncertainty), as well as by proxy variables for allocative efficiency and firm
capabilities. The finding that all three theories (TCE, neoclassical economics and firm
capabilities) contribute to the choice of sourcing mode illustrates the firm’s desire to
simultaneously monitor suppliers, produce efficiently and improve processes
(Parmigiani, 2007). Schnaider and Saes (2011) also argue that plural forms are stable
in the long term, since they allow companies to take advantage of market incentives,
increase the level of monitoring and coordination of transactions and production
activities. Hybrid forms, vertical integration and the spot market can be
simultaneously adopted to reduce both transaction and production costs.
Menard (2011) developed a theoretical framework that aligns most of the arguments
presented in the literature to explain the existence of plural forms of governance.
According to the author, three determinants play a major role: “ambiguity surrounding
the fitness of a mode of organisation for the transaction in question; complexity of a

transaction or a set of transactions; and strategic behaviour”. There will be ambiguity
about the choice of the governance because the degree of specificity of assets involved
cannot be assessed precisely. In these cases, the expected benefits from one type of
governance or another cannot be precisely evaluated. It is almost impossible to assess
the marginal advantages of one mode of organisation over another, so plural forms are
adopted.
The second determinant is the complexity of some transactions, which can generate
uncertainties about the appropriate manner to monitor the transaction. In this case, the
problem is not one of evaluating the specificities of the assets, but rather the problem of
finding an appropriate manner of monitoring the transactions. In highly complex
transactions, the risk of adopting only one form of governance can be quite high,
increasing transactions costs and generating inefficiencies for the firms. The solution
would be to adopt plural forms to mitigate the risk generated by the complexity. The
third determinant for adoption of plural forms is the strategic behaviour in the
organisation of certain transactions. This happens “when a party intends to take the
lead of the relationship by determining the governance structure of the arrangement
but faces problems of coordination or control that could challenge his capacity to reap
the benefits.” The use of different organisational forms can facilitate monitoring and
control, so that a more significant part of the rent can be captured. Menard (2011)
concluded that the firms could find different solutions to govern similar transactions,
adopting plural forms and generating multiple equilibria, unlike the single equilibrium
(resulting from the adoption of the form of governance that minimises transaction
costs) proposed by Williamson (1991).
In summary, the body of studies reviewed establishes the following explanations
and advantages for the adoption of plural forms: transaction characteristics (asset
specificity, uncertainty, frequency, ambiguity and complexity); effects of the
institutional environment; complementarity of the forms (generation of synergies,
cross-learning effects); ensuring flexibility when faced with the
uncertainties/complexities of the transactions and variations in demand; resolving
the problem of information asymmetry to avoid adverse selection and moral risk.
3. Methodology
A case study format was selected for this investigation. The focal company selected
offers a large number of products derived from beef for different commercialisation
channels in the domestic and foreign market. The company has therefore adopted a
wide range of commercialisation strategies to both sell beef products and buy cattle.
However, data on the quantity of cattle it buys, according to each type of governance
was not provided them, because it was considered strategic information.
Notwithstanding, a non-probability sample of 30 suppliers (cattle farmers) of the
focal company provided data on finished steers sold in 2010, according to the three
types of governance used in the transactions (spot market, forward contracts and
long-term contracts). Out of a total of 74,301 cattle, 31,818 (43 per cent) were
commercialised using a forward contract, 24,000 cattle (32 per cent) were
commercialised using a long-term contract established with the owner of the
integrated cattle farm that is certified to export to the EU, and 18,483 cattle (25 per cent)
were commercialised through the spot market. These data corroborate the qualitative

information obtained through interviews with the manager of market operations of the
focal company regarding the use of plural forms of governance for purchase of cattle.
The company has six slaughterhouses located in different Brazilian states, two
slaughterhouses abroad, 11 distribution centres in Brazil and offices in the main
countries to which it exports its products. In 2010, 192,900 tons of in natura beef was
sold on the international market and 121,600 tons in the domestic market. The main
destinations of beef exported were the Middle East (26.1 per cent of the volume
exported), followed by Russia and other states of the former Soviet Union (25.8 per
cent), the Americas (19 per cent), Africa (14.9 per cent), Europe (8.7 per cent) and Asia
(5.3 per cent). The company was responsible for 20.2 per cent of the total revenue from
Brazilian exports of beef for the year 2010.
Interviews were carried out with the manager of market operations for the focal
company, a specialist in the finished cattle market and a certification specialist. For
these interviews a semi-structured questionnaire was used to obtain information that
enabled: the mapping of the supply chain of the focal company, covering the different
distribution channels and types of suppliers; identification of the product attributes
valued in the distribution channels; identification of the features of the transactions
with the suppliers and the forms of governance being used; and identification of major
determinants of governance strategies that the focal firm is following. A previous
version of the results was submitted to the manager of market operations of the focal
company for validation of the results.
4. Results and discussion
Figure 1 shows a diagram of the supply chain of the focal company, which is located at
the centre of the figure. Its transactions with different distribution channels and
suppliers are represented by solid lines and identified by Tn. Two main distribution
channels were identified for the domestic market and two for the foreign market. In the
domestic market, the meat processing plant serves the meat demand for barbecue
houses (T1) and retailers (T2). In the foreign market, there are clients from the EU (T4)
and other countries (T3). Each one of these distribution channels has its own
characteristics and values different attributes of the beef.

To meet this demand, the focal company obtains beef cattle through transactions with
independent cattle farmers (spot market, T6; forward contract, T7), independent cattle
farmers certified to export to the EU (forward contracts, T8; and spot market, T9), an
integrated farm using a partnership model (T10) and intermediaries (T12), as well as
from production on their own farms (T5). The intermediaries also obtain beef cattle
through transactions with other cattle farmers, but this is outside the scope of the
analysis of this study and is not represented in Figure 1. It is important to note that
transaction T11, the only transaction represented by a dotted line, is carried out
between the focal company and cattle farmers who raise backgrounding steers. This
transaction does not involve direct physical flow of animals between these farmers and
the focal company, and is part of a wider arrangement of partnerships coordinated by
the focal company, which will be further explained later.
Table I shows a summary of the transactions established by the focal company with
the different commercialisation channels (downstream) and level 1 cattle farms
(upstream). The transactions with cattle farmers are further classified according to
their priority (priority and marginal). The priority transactions for the purchase of
cattle are those that occur more frequently and with higher volume. They serve the
demands of the respective commercialisation channel more efficiently. The marginal
transactions are those that occur sporadically.
Note that to serve the barbecue houses (T1), only one type of transaction was used
(T5). However, to serve the remaining commercialisation channels, two or more
transaction types are always used. The most extreme case is serving the demands of
the domestic retail market, which can be carried out using four types of coordination.
The following sections describe the relationship between the beef attributes desired
by the main distribution channels and the governance structure established in each
transaction for the acquisition of cattle.
4.1 Barbecue houses
The focal company uses a T1 transaction to serve barbecue houses. These
establishments value organoleptic characteristics, such as tenderness and flavour.
These characteristics, as described by Azevedo (2000), are experiential, meaning that
they are only observable during consumption. The presence of these organoleptic
characteristics in the final product depends on a set of factors (animal genetics, animal
nutrition, production system and industrial processes) that are not visible to the end
consumer, and are also many times not visible to the focal company.
To resolve the problems of measuring the quality of the raw material and the final
product, Azevedo (2000) proposed the use of long-term contractual arrangements with

the suppliers or the vertical integration of production. These two forms of
commercialisation have the potential to minimise the problems of measuring
characteristics of the raw material, increasing control over the process of raw material
production and, consequently, increasing the quality of the final product. In fact, to
serve the distribution channel represented by the barbecue houses/grills, the focal
company generally uses vertical integration (transaction T5). On its own farms
animals are produced that meet the organoleptic characteristics of flavour and
tenderness that are valued by this distribution channel. According to the interview
with the manager of market operations, by internalising part of the production, the
company reduces information problems and costs associated with measuring
characteristics of experiential goods, in addition to considerably increasing control
over the quality of the raw material, therefore reducing transaction costs. However, by
internalising part of the production of raw material, the company increases its
production costs, which is compensated by higher prices paid by agents of this
distribution channel.
4.2 Retailers
The distribution channel represented by the retailers (small, medium and large retail
chains) is served by the focal company using the T2 transaction. In this type of
transaction, the cuts of beef are standardised and sold under the focal company’s own
brand. This distribution channel is less demanding than barbecue houses with regard
to organoleptic characteristics. In this case, the attributes most valued by the consumer
at the time of purchase are price and quantity. However, the increase in per capita
income and purchasing power of the Brazilians has changed food consumption habits
and made the Brazilian consumer increasingly demanding, mainly with regard to meat
quality and food safety. The persistence of this increase in income points to continued
changes in attributes valued in this distribution channel and includes the emergence of
more demanding market niches.
To serve the distribution channel represented by the small, medium and large retail
chains (transaction T2), the focal company acquires raw material from independent
cattle farmers. These transactions occur predominantly through the spot market
(transaction T6) and through forward contracts (transaction T7). To a much lesser
extent, the focal company also uses animals from its own farms (transaction T5) to
serve this distribution channel.
In the transactions formalised by means of a forward contract, clauses concerning
the future delivery date of the animals, quantity, weight, age and sex of the animals, in
addition to price, are pre-established. The price is calculated based on the indicator
ESALQ/BM&F[1], with the addition or not of a premium. This premium is determined
by the supply and demand conditions of the market and by the quality of the animal.
For the cattle farmer, the forward contract allows the technical and financial
scheduling of production and reduces the risk due to greater specificity of the asset and
uncertainty of the institutional environment, ensuring the future sale of the product at
a pre-determined price and encouraging investment in improvements to the production
processes with possible gains in quality and productivity. For the focal company, it
ensures the supply of raw material with pre-specified standards of quality and allows
better planning and control of supply and production with consequent gains in
coordination and competitiveness.

With a more comfortable position from which to plan its operations, including a
lower risk of raw material shortages, the company increases its bargaining power in
transactions with cattle farmers on the spot market. In other words, the more secure
availability of animals purchased through forward contracts reduces dependence on
the spot market and, in this way, the company can obtain lower prices than the average
observed in this market. This strategy corroborates the idea that the use of plural
forms of governance enables gains from synergies (Brousseau and Codron, 1997;
Parmigiani, 2007; Schnaider and Saes, 2011; Menard, 2011). In the case of the present
study, the focal company takes advantage of the potential for financial planning, scale
and quality that the forward contract can offer and, as a result, obtains lower prices on
the spot market. This supply strategy adopted by the focal firm corroborates the
pioneering vision of Bradach and Eccles (1989) that the adoption of plural forms of
governance is related to the use of one form of governance to manage the other.
It is also important to note that in some regions of Brazil, the focal company
conducts transactions with intermediaries, carried out through the spot market
(transaction T12) to acquire finished steers that will be used in the production of beef
for the retail market. These intermediaries purchase animals from various small
producers and resell them, with gains from scale, to the focal company. However, these
transactions are marginal and tend to shrink as the market evolves and as the
company reduces transaction costs and increases control over the quality of the raw
material.
4.3 EU
The EU market (transaction T4) is demanding with regard to organoleptic
characteristics of the beef and food safety. This distribution channel also requires
the traceability of the animals, from rural production until slaughter. The traceability
system used in Brazil, known as SISBOV[2], is supervised by the Ministry of
Agriculture, Livestock and Supply (MAPA), which is responsible for certifying the
farms where cattle are obtained for meat production and exported to the EU[3].
The rural producer who wants to raise animals that can be used in the production of
beef for export to the EU must meet the following requirements: SISBOV enrolment,
producer registration, farm registration, basic production protocol, record of inputs
used at the farm, individual identification of all of the cattle on the farm, control of
animal transfer and monitoring by a single certification agency. The certification
process is relatively slow and must be audited on a bi-annual basis by MAPA.
Certification for export to the EU is also used as a benchmark for other countries, such
as Russia and the Middle East (Vinholis and Souza, 2010).
The set of requirements imposed by the EU increases the specificity of the raw
material, pointing to a need to build a relationship that is closer and more coordinated
between the focal company and its suppliers. In this way, to purchase animals that will
meet the requirements of this commercialisation channel, the focal company uses T8,
T9 and T10 transactions, detailed as follows.
To obtain finished steers using the T10 transaction, the company coordinates
partnerships with two types of animal suppliers: a large cattle farmer (owner of a farm
certified for export to the EU) and a group of cattle farmers supplying backgrounding
steers (raised on uncertified farms) (Figure 1). The focal company purchases
backgrounding steers from the uncertified farms (T11) to then supply the certified

finishing farm[4, 5]. The T11 transaction does not involve the direct flow of animals,
but the negotiation of backgrounding steers that will be fattened and confined on the
certified farm, and then later slaughtered by the focal company. Payment for these
backgrounding steers to the cattle farmers will be made by the focal company only
after the finishing stage on the certified farm, in other words, at slaughter, with the
price determined at time of purchase or set on the date of slaughter using that day’s
market price. The integrated confinement farm has the capacity to fatten 24,000 head
of cattle a year, and is dedicated exclusively to the final production phase of the
animals, which consists of a 90-day confinement. The focal company formalises a
long-term partnership contract with the owner of the cattle farm in which he pledges to
supply backgrounding steers and technical assistance, as well as the predetermined
amount of R$ 0.50 per 15 kg of fattened animal. The monetary value of the weight gain
obtained by the cattle on the farm (the difference in weight upon entering and leaving
confinement) is paid by the focal company. With this governance structure, the focal
company ensures a supply of high-quality cattle that it needs to serve the EU. The
following list presents the advantages that the governance structure developed and
coordinated by the focal company for transaction T10 can provide to the three agents
involved:
(1) Advantages for the livestock suppliers of backgrounding steers:
. the ability to export to the EU and receive half the Europe premium without
being on the TRACES list and without having to pay the costs of
traceability;
. the ability to establish a forward contract with the meat processing plant,
protecting itself from price variations in cattle and ensuring its sale; and
. resting of pasture during the dry season, when animals go to the finishing
farm, providing increased capacity during the rainy season and increased
productivity.
(2) Advantages for the focal company:
. the company maintains a safe stock of 24,000 head of cattle per year through
a long-term contract with the owner of the finishing farm;
. despite having to pay for part of the production costs (animal nutrition and
consulting), the company can focus on its core activity by outsourcing the
raising and fattening of animals; and
. control over the quality of raw material through incentives for use of
management and nutrition techniques.
(3) Advantages for the owner of the finishing farm:
. receives a set price per head and pays no transaction costs, since the focal
company negotiates the purchase of the animals for finishing on the certified
farm and all the animals are slaughtered at the focal company itself;
. receives the necessary technical assistance for production, reducing
production costs; and
. the opportunity to focus solely on production with resulting gains in
productivity and increases in remuneration.

Following the proposal developed by Lazzarini et al. (2001), the partnership model
coordinated by the focal company establishes three types of interdependence between
the agents: the first is group interdependence between the farmers raising the
backgrounding steers and the owner of the certified farm; the second is the sequential
interdependence between the farmers raising the backgrounding steers and the focal
company; and the third is the reciprocal interdependence between the owner of the
certified farm and the focal company.
The partnership model identified in this work points to a trend in the development
of new coordination arrangements in the production chain of Brazilian beef. The
partnership/structure model of governance analysed is designed to reduce both the
costs of obtaining information on raw material through traceability and also other
transaction costs through contracts used between the focal company and the owner of
the farm and between the focal company and the cattle farmers. The partnership
arrangement also has the objective of encouraging investments in quality in cattle
raising and ensuring the supply of quality cattle for the focal company, in addition to
potentially increasing the profitability of all agents involved. It is important to stress
that no similar partnership arrangements were found in the literature for the beef
production chain in Brazil, indicating that it is an innovation in relations between meat
processing plants and cattle farmers.
The governance established above was not sufficient to meet the demand of the
focal company for certified animals. To do so, the company had to establish a second
type of governance for transactions (transaction T8) with other cattle farmers, whose
farms were also certified. This governance is characterised by the use of forward
contracts, whose advantages and design have already been explained. However, in the
case of purchasing cattle to meet EU demand, there are two basic conditions in the
design of these contracts. The first condition is that the cattle raising farm must be
listed on TRACES, in other words, it must be duly certified for export; and the second
refers to the price for fattening, which could be defined as a bonus, and is known as the
Europe premium.
Marginally, the focal company can also purchase animals from certified farms
through the spot market (transaction T9) to serve the EU. This governance mechanism
would not be the most suitable in this case, given the high specificity of the asset
traded. However, these transactions become feasible when the focal company conducts
a large number or high frequency of transactions with certain cattle farmers, thus
creating an environment of trust, and making forward contracts unnecessary.
Although these transactions are carried out on the spot market, the Europe premium is
also paid.
The strategy of adopting plural forms for the supply of animals enabled the focal
firm to obtain greater flexibility and reduce the risks associated with meeting EU
demand. In fact, the demand from the EU for traceable beef in Brazil has been unstable,
whether due to factors related to changes in the income of the European consumer or
embargos associated with technical barriers to trade. Faced with a sudden fall in
demand for Brazilian beef, the focal firm ends their purchase operations for traceable
finished steers on the spot market, or removes the Europe premium offered on these
operations. In this way, the firm avoids the costs associated with ex post changes in the
institutional environment. However, it is not able to avoid these costs in operations
involving partnerships or forward contracts for traceable cattle. Even if the firm is able

to redirect the surplus to other commercialisation channels, it is unlikely to obtain
premium prices that justify the adoption of such forms of governance. Against a
backdrop of rising European demand for Brazilian beef, the opposite occurs. The focal
company sustains its purchase operations using the partnership model and forward
contracts, and can also expand its purchases using the spot market. In this case, the
Europe premium tends to rise until the supply of traceable cattle adjusts to the new
demand. The adoption of plural forms of governance allows the focal company to meet
the requirements of the EU in terms of beef quality attributes, without having to
internalise production, bear the burden of all the production costs or lose the incentives
offered by the market upstream.
4.4 Other countries
The distribution channels of foreign markets that do not require a traceability system
like the European one are served using T3 transactions. In these transactions,
guarantees are offered by the Official Veterinary Services, by means of a declaration
from the producer attesting to the rural property origin of the animals and supervised
by the Official Veterinary Service. The principal demands are limited to requirements
of the Export Health Certificate, which includes, for example, that the animals must be
less than 30 months old (Vinholis and Souza, 2010).
To serve the foreign market distribution channels regarding T3, the focal company
purchases animals through the spot market (T6) and forward contracts (T7), and from
their own farms (T5). Since these distribution channels do not require EU standard
traceability, the asset is much less specific than the asset for that market. However,
efforts are made by the focal company to obtain the highest quality raw material to
serve these channels, given its strategy to increase competitiveness in the foreign
market. In transactions using forward contracts and vertical integration, as just
mentioned, there is the possibility of reducing transaction and measuring costs and
encouraging investment in the quality of raw material through the promise of future
transactions and payment of premiums, in the case of high quality cattle. In the
transactions carried out on the spot market, quality control and incentives for
investment in quality are reduced.
The supply strategy to serve the distribution channel represented by other countries
(transaction T3) is very similar to the strategy for serving domestic market retail
chains (transaction T2). In both cases the focal firm uses the spot market in conjunction
with other forward contracts and, sporadically, vertical integration. As already
emphasised, there are three advantages derived from the use of this supply strategy
that became evident in the present study: i) greater flexibility in adjusting to changes in
demand; ii) ability to take advantage of synergies, making use of the pre-determined
scale contained in the forward contract to increase bargaining power and pay lower
prices on the spot market; iii) a decrease in information asymmetry in the transactions
using vertical integration, enabling the acquisition of more knowledge about the
production of the raw material, and consequently more control over the suppliers of
raw material.
4.5 Complexity and strategy
The classification established by Menard (2011) allows us to conclude that the plural
forms adopted for the upstream transactions were determined by the complexity of

transactions in certain commercialisation channels, as well as the strategic behaviour
of the focal firm. Table II presents the role of each of the determinants established by
Menard (2011).
To meet the demand of barbecue houses, the focal firm does not adopt plural forms
of governance for the supply of raw material. In the case of retailers in the domestic
market, the adoption of plural forms upstream is determined by the supply strategy of
the firm. These transactions present neither ambiguity nor complexity. The use of
plural forms is a strategy for securing in advance a part of the supply of animals, by
adopting forward contracts, and, simultaneously, reaping the benefits of the spot
market. Cross-learning effects are also an advantage of this strategy.
To meet the strict requirements of the EU, the adoption of plural forms is mainly the
result of the complexity of the transactions upstream. The inherent uncertainties of the
institutional environment and the need to obtain traceable animals of high quality
make these transactions complex and risky. The focal firm uses plural forms as a way
to keep these factors under control. In the case of other countries, the adoption of plural
forms is determined by the strategy of the firm. In this case, the supply strategy is
similar to the strategy adopted to serve retailers in the domestic market.
5. Final considerations
The present case study showed that the governance structures in the transactions
between cattle farmers and meat processing plants change according to consumer
demands and institutional environment. Plural forms of governance were adopted as a
strategy for coordinating transactions and because of the complexity of some
transactions. The focal company uses different forms of governance with their
suppliers to serve different distribution channels in an effort to take advantage of the
synergies that the different forms provide and to keep uncertainties about the quality
and quantity of raw materials under control. The company uses the spot market,
hybrid forms and vertical integration to purchase cattle. This strategy provides a
competitive advantage, since it allows the company to serve different distribution
channels, with different levels of requirements in terms of quality and other product
attributes. It reduces the risk of depending on just a few suppliers by diversifying
supply strategies. It also reduces the risk that comes from complexity and
unpredictable institutional environment in the international market.

The adoption of plural forms allows the company to improve its planning and control
of supply, with consequent gains in the use of installed capacity. The strategy of
adopting plural forms also appears to be gaining ground in other companies and in
other sectors, and deserves further in-depth study. This study is novel in pointing out
the advantages that this strategy can provide based on a case study carried out at a
large company of the beef industry that serves different distribution channels with
differentiated products (in terms of quality and packaging/cuts).
Most empirical studies on plural forms evaluate their existence within a sector or
production chain, without wondering whether plural forms exist within a single
company. Furthermore, most of these studies do not take into consideration the impact
that the differentiation of product and distribution channels can have on the adoption
of plural forms of governance when make their evaluations. In fact, the analytical
model used in these studies implicitly presumes that the companies offer a single
homogeneous product and must decide on the form of governance to be adopted for the
supply of the most important input (upstream transactions) (Heide, 2003; Parmigiani,
2007; Mello and Paulillo, 2010). This simplification of the real world leads these studies
to disregard the effect of differentiation of product and distribution channels on the
supply strategy that the company is following. Also, these studies do not take into
account the role played by a given and pre-existing heterogeneity of input suppliers. In
the present study it was found that both the specificity of the final product, as well as
the availability of a wide range of suppliers of raw material, employing different
production technologies, are determinant factors for the focal company adopting plural
forms.
The case study presented here corroborates the vision that plural forms of
governance are aligned with the model provided by Menard (2011). In the case
presented, plurality is more efficient than the adoption of only one form of governance.
This can be explained by the complexity of some transactions, by the different
characteristics of the assets involved and by the supply strategy of the company.
Plurality is not a situation of disequilibrium, but rather a question of multiple
equilibria found to efficiently serve the diversity of existing distribution channels. It is
possible to set price and quality strategies, and ensure the flexibility needed to face
uncertainties about the quantity and quality of production, as suggested by Brousseau
and Codron (1997), Silva and Azevedo (2007), Perrigot et al. (2009) and Menard (2011).
The adoption of plural forms of governance allowed the Brazilian beef export
industry to match the heterogeneity in the supply of beef cattle in Brazil with the
heterogeneity of the beef market in both domestic and foreign markets. This strategy
has provided competitive advantages for the Brazilian beef chain in the international
market.

4. The animals that will be slaughtered and sent to the EU must remain on a certified farm
(Rural Establishment Approved in the SISBOV – ERAS) for a period of 90 days before being
shipped to the meat processing plant. Before this 90-day period, the animals can be raised on
uncertified farms.
5. In Brazil, the cattle production cycle is traditionally composed of three production phases:
pre-weaning, post-weaning and finishing. These phases can be carried out separately on
different farms or on the same farm. The pre-weaning phase requires the largest amount of
land per animal. Therefore, this phase is normally carried out in regions where the land cost
is lower. The finishing phase, on the other hand, can be more capital intensive and requires
less area per animal, therefore, it is economically viable in regions where the cost of land is
higher.
