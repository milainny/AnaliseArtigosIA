 explicitly compensated hog carcass weight leanness . arrangements 
 accounted approximately 69 percent hogs sold 2004 , compared 11 percent 
 1993 , less 2 percent 1980 (grimes plain , 2009 ; hayenga et al . , 1996 ; 
 marion , 1985) . 
 rapid increase marketing contracts concern policymakers . 
 marketing contracts replace hog sales spot market , spot prices based 
 fewer sales . consequently , markets may become highly volatile , subject 
 manipulation , less representative competitive market equilibrium . may 
 lead misallocated resources lower social welfare marketing contract 
 prices typically tied spot price . moreover , smaller independent producers 
 complain packers prefer contract larger producers price 
 premiums paid made publicly available . response producer concerns 
 price transparency , beginning april 2001 , us department agriculture 
 (usda) implemented livestock mandatory price reporting program provide 
 segments livestock meat industries information base 
 market decisions . 
 hand , survey evidence suggests long-term marketing agreements 
 play important role addressing pork quality problems . example , lawrence 
 et al . (2001) surveyed 11 largest us pork packers , representing 77 percent total 
 hog slaughter , determine reasons entering formal marketing agreements . 
 primary reasons included : obtain consistent supply high quality hogs , obtain 
 higher quality hogs , improve food safety . market intervention policies 
 restrict changes organization pork markets reduce social welfare 
 changes efficient responses marketing environment . case study 
 explores shift marketing contracts facilitate pork quality 
 improvements us pork industry using small sample hog marketing 
 contracts 1996 2001 . 
 marketing contracts product quality 
 marketing contracts can facilitate improvements product quality several ways . 
 first , can reduce measurement , information , costs , include costs 
 searching information buyers sellers market , inspecting goods prior 
 purchase , assigning price (hallwood , 1990 ; hobbs , 1996) . measuring costs may 
 especially significant transactions heterogeneous (e . g . , vary premiums 
 placed quality characteristics across transactions time) , characterized 
 asymmetric information (lafontaine masten , 2002 ; williamson , 1985) . two 
 types asymmetric information can distinguished . seller may 
 information buyer difficult-to-measure quality attribute , 
 individual’s contribution quality outcome determined measuring 
 finished product . marketing contracts may reduce costs associated 
 assuring closer correspondence product value price , actions 
 rewards (barzel , 1982 ; williamson , 1985) . 
 measuring difficulties associated overcoming asymmetric quality information 
 may also viewed “exchange hazard” (williamson , 2000 ; poppo zenger , 
 2002) . hog quality attributes difficult measure producer may engage 
 opportunistic behavior exploit private information failing perform agreed , 
 shirking cutting corners quality , also referred moral hazard .

 expected lead contracts added security features mitigate hazard , 
 provisions third party monitoring sellers , documents justify activities 
 performed , means increasing information disclosure . 
 second , marketing contracts can facilitate adaptations uncertainties 
 marketplace (masten , 1996 ; ryall sampson , 2003) . matching producers’ hogs 
 quality needs packers may require continual revision light changing customer 
 demands quality standards . market uncertainty increases , becomes 
 costly write enforceable , complete contracts detail behavior contingent future 
 outcomes . leaves opportunities parties engage opportunistic behavior 
 avoid compliance increases likelihood parties will fail optimally adapt 
 changing conditions . consequently , contracts likely become “relational” 
 nature . , rather laying detailed terms cooperation , contracts 
 likely specify process terms will established . making contract 
 terms less explicit , transaction costs associated renegotiating revising 
 contract terms reduced light uncertain future demand quality needs . 
 third , cases packer unaware actions producer , two options 
 available limit moral hazard (eisenhardt , 1989) . contracts may reward producers 
 based , least partially , outcomes behavior (outcome-oriented contract) , 
 packer may invest information producer behavior (behavior-oriented 
 contract) . optimal performance evaluation strategy (behavior-oriented versus 
 outcome-oriented) will depend ability measure quality outcomes related 
 inputs . quality outcomes difficult measure difficult measure 
 reasonable amount time , behavior-oriented contracts will become attractive . 
 behavior-based contracts likely producer activities can easily defined 
 evaluated , production process highly task programmable , makes 
 easier specify appropriate producer behavior advance (eisenhardt , 1989) . 
 producers involved several valuable activities affect multiple , 
 important quality attributes , measurability attributes vary , explicit 
 incentives easily measured will reduced (holmstrom milgrom , 
 1991) . compensation based solely measurable outcome , 
 volume supplied , may lead poor performance immeasurable outcome , 
 dimension pork quality . similarly , explicit incentives individual 
 producer’s contribution easily assessed activity lead producer 
 neglect team production activities . presence incentive clauses easily 
 measured quality outcomes will influenced ability identify producer 
 activities affect immeasurable attributes . 
 increasing emphasis pork quality 
 pork quality characteristics make meat desirable . consumers , quality 
 may determined aesthetics (taste , smell , texture , color) ; nutrition (vitamins , 
 proteins , minerals , energy , type proportion fat) ; safety (absence pathogens , 
 toxins) ; intangible qualities (organic , meat produced high standards animal 
 welfare) ; characteristics convenience reliability . pork processors 
 identify several determinants pork quality : low “drip loss , ” fluid lost 
 fresh , uncooked pork ; color color consistency ; limited external fat ; absence 
 defects (morgan et al . , 1994) .

 1990s , several developments moved pork quality concerns forefront 
 usa . renewed emphasis leanness emerged decade 1980s 
 human health research reports linking fat cholesterol cardiovascular disease 
 people (robenstein thurman , 1996) . although live hog grading proved 
 effective encouraging farmers reduce fat content hogs , progress 
 slowed late 1980s , health conscious consumers apparently willing 
 pay even less fat (kenyon purcell , 1999 ; hayenga et al . , 1985) . 
 1992 , several largest pork packing companies adopted new carcass 
 measurement technology , referred fat-o-meater . technology optical 
 probe , used distinguish backfat lean tissue , combined scale linked 
 computer . backfat thickness loin muscle depth , combined carcass 
 weight , used calculate estimated percent carcass lean . 
 detailed measurements computing capability allowed packers introduce 
 “pricing grids” : schedule price adjustments base price depend 
 carcass weight percent lean . carcass pricing grids , also referred carcass 
 merit programs carcass value pricing programs , provide precise 
 measures leanness suggest higher expected price stronger incentives 
 producing leaner hogs . evidence collected six large meat packers southeast 
 showed carcass pricing grids providing significant incentives producers 
 raise larger , leaner , more-muscled hogs (kenyon et al . , 1995) . 
 pork industry experienced significant growth carcass pricing programs 
 1990s . reported usda , percentage hogs purchased packers based 
 carcass evaluation increased 11 percent 1990 , 25 percent 1993 , 
 72 percent 2001 . 2007 , hogs purchased carcass basis reached 79 percent 
 total hog slaughter . popularity carcass pricing programs grew , leaner 
 muscular hogs became available heavier , desirable weights (table i) . 
 according meisinger (2000) , progress made 1990s reduce carcass 
 fat increase muscling previous four decades combined . 
 pale , soft , exudative pork 
 renewed emphasis placed producing lean , well muscled hogs 1990s , 
 pork quality continued change ways . particular , relatively high 
 incidence “pale , soft , exudative” (pse) pork became apparent . pse fresh 
 pork classification category defined light color , soft texture (or lack 
 firmness) , exudative exhibiting high degree drip-loss slaughter . 
 attributes found associated porcine stress syndrome (pss) gene (or 
 stress gene) , carried leaner genetic lines (smith , 1999) . hence , 
 hogs became leaner heavily muscled , also susceptible 
 producing pork pse condition .

 pse pork quickly became recognized undesirable qualities (kaufman et al . , 
 1994) . economic losses associated pse included reduced yield processing 
 cooking , drip loss retail display trays , reduced shelf life , increased quality 
 variation , reduced consumer appeal . panel scores suggest pale-colored pork 
 less acceptable consumers (mckeith et al . , 1996) . pse pork also less tender 
 increased cooking losses . 
 time , packers attempted differentiate products 
 branding programs , pork quality standards consistency became increasingly 
 important . lawrence et al . ’s (2001) survey 11 large us pork packers , packers 
 reported need increased quality control consistency response greater 
 demand pork customers ultimate consumers . survey also found 
 branded programs packers rapidly increasing , accounting 18 
 percent 1999 sales volume , expected represent even larger share 
 2004 . eight-year period 1996 2003 , three times many branded 
 fresh pork products introduced compared previous eight years 
 (datamonitor , 2003) . 
 meat safety 
 another development raised quality awareness spate meat safety recalls 
 food companies 1990s . events heightened media attention 
 consumer awareness importance containing microbial hazards (shane , 1999) . 
 heels jack-in-the-box beef recall 1993 , new regulatory initiatives 
 meat poultry industries designed replace “poke sniff” inspection 
 methods detecting tainted meat . 1996 , usda , food safety inspection 
 service published final pathogen reduction regulation meat poultry 
 industry (unnevehr et al . , 1998) . set standards reducing microbial pathogens 
 meat poultry products required meat poultry plants implement hazard 
 analysis critical control point (haccp) plans . 
 haccp preventative approach controlling biological , physical , chemical 
 food safety hazards . part haccp program , companies identify types 
 hazards affect products , institute controls prevent minimize 
 hazards , monitor results controls , maintain records monitoring efforts . 
 event problems found , packer required take corrective action 
 locating eliminating cause establishing preventative measures . 
 government oversees process verifies adequacy . effect , haccp shifted 
 responsibility safety government meat packers . mandated use 
 haccp reflected growing importance preventing controlling safety 
 problems products reach consumer (unnevehr , 2003) . 
 pork exports 
 us pork industry experienced unprecedented growth exports 1990s , 
 increasing 1 . 6 percent production 1990 8 . 6 percent 2003 . north 
 american free trade agreement (nafta) uruguay round general 
 agreement tariffs trade (gatt) opened previously protected markets . 
 technological advances allowed us exporters ship chilled pork products japan ,

 pork industry due outbreak foot-and-mouth disease , opened 
 door exporters . 
 pork product quality customized service major factors affecting global 
 trade pork products . consequently , us pork export markets fueled new business 
 opportunities , addressing pork quality problems became important . example , 
 1990s , usa made significant progress toward overtaking denmark (a major 
 us export competitor) leading exporter japan , meat quality issues 
 especially important . 1990 survey japanese consumers regarding factors 
 affect selection pork products found food safety , fat intake , taste , freshness 
 among quality characteristics ranked high (sapp knipe , 1990) . 
 marketing contracts carcass pricing programs 
 advances measurement technology enabled accurate less expensive 
 measures carcass leanness , packers offer grids narrower groupings 
 leanness carcass weight . addition added packer costs related 
 record-keeping maintaining producer identity (mccoy sarhan , 1988) , 
 carcass grading programs narrow quality groupings likely increase costs 
 sorting pricing hogs . 
 move carcass pricing programs also likely raised producer costs associated 
 comparing alternative packer pricing programs several reasons . first , 
 meat packer different premium discount schedules , depending type 
 outlet products sold . example , packers hormel , process much 
 pork , prefer lighter carcass . others , excel , prefer heavier carcass 
 boned boxed products . marbery (2000a) writes restaurants prefer relatively 
 small loins , come 215-230 pound hogs compared standard 
 270-pound hog . packer exports japan prefers leaner pork . 
 second , instruments used measure lean vary across packers . 2000 , among 
 nation’s 32 largest plants owned 13 packers , seven packers used 
 fat-o-meater , employs light diffraction measure fat loin depth . ultrafom 
 animal ultrasound systems (aus) , measure fat depth loin depth 
 ultrasound rather light diffraction , used three companies . two packers 
 used low technology ruler measurement midline backfat estimate lean . 
 sophisticated measuring device , autofom , also uses ultrasound scans carcasses 
 2 , 000 points monitors intramuscular fat , ph color (pse pork indicators) 
 cooler . device used hatfield became operational one hormel’s 
 plants 2000 . differences led significant grading program disparities across 
 packers . 
 third factor complicating price comparisons across packers carcass merit 
 matrices may revised packer , suggests producers must continually 
 reevaluate alternative packer buying programs . buying programs 
 continually adjusted increase compensation leaner hogs , packers 
 narrowing ideal carcass weight ranges provide consistent products . 
 packer resistance toward making programs public also complicated producers’ 
 ability evaluate alternative programs[1] . 
 along growing importance carcass pricing grids , marketing contracts 
 packers producers quickly supplanted much spot market trade .

 packer’s carcass pricing grid , current live spot market price (e . g . , iowa-southern 
 minnesota plant prices) serving base price (lawrence et al . , 1997 ; hayenga et al . , 
 1996) . 
 given changes pricing system , two features marketing contracts 
 lower packer producer measuring costs compared spot markets . first , long-term 
 agreements may reduce search costs associated finding suitable trading partners . 
 duration hog marketing contracts four seven years (kenyon 
 purcell , 1999) , can reduce producers’ costs associated reevaluating packer 
 grids sales interval . similarly , packer costs associated identifying suitable 
 producers incurred long-term intervals . 
 second , minimum quantity requirements help assure packers hogs 
 uniform quality , allows packers engage much less testing time 
 exchange . 1994 survey largest us pork packers revealed almost half 
 13 packers involved formal , written contracts minimum volume 
 requirements , either minimum quality requirements breeding / genetic 
 stipulations (hayenga et al . , 1996) . large numbers hogs produced similar 
 breeding , nutrition , health , production conditions give packer 
 useful information hogs measuring . also , much 
 difference typical versus ideal hog related genetics (kenyon et al . , 1995) , 
 stipulations regarding genetics provide assurances uniform quality . genetic 
 traits directly effect meat quality include intra-muscular fat (that , marbling) , 
 meat color , ph , tenderness . 
 contract design control quality limit measuring costs 
 carcass pricing grids provided strong incentives leanness , growing 
 prevalence pse-related characteristics safety concerns expected lead 
 efforts control attributes well . however , measuring costs associated 
 attributes provided obstacles compensating producers . packers 
 readily grade hogs using pse indicators (for example ph , color , water holding 
 capacity) difficult apply high-speed slaughter lines kill 1000 
 hogs per hour (3 seconds per carcass) (marbery , 2000b) . 2000 , forrest et al . (2000) 
 noted predicting color water holding capacity pork one 
 difficult important challenges facing meat scientists . 
 biological (bacteria , viruses , etc . ) chemical (antibiotics , hormones , etc . ) 
 contaminants also presented measurement difficulties . testing pathogen content 
 different stages supply chain often difficult rapid tests 
 available (unnevehr jensen , 2001) . microbiological chemical residue testing 
 limited value time required obtain results permit action 
 taken meat processed . 
 pse safety attributes presented measuring difficulties , relationships 
 attributes production activities became better known . research 
 improved knowledge link pse problems hog production inputs 
 (smith , 1999) . producers responsible 50 percent pse problems , mostly 
 choice genetics . hogs bred lean well-muscled , 
 breeding led stress-prone hogs . producers can reduce hog stress several 
 ways , including minimizing use electric prods , designing finishing facilities 
 optimize environmental conditions , using feed additives .

 addition minimum quality requirements breeding / genetic specifications required

 several clauses relate food safety . stark contrast earlier 1993 survey , nearly 
 packers provisions required producers certified level iii pqa 
 higher . half contracts required producers supervised licensed 
 veterinarian . five contracts offered three packers provisions require 
 producers comply company haccp programs place . 
 five contracts specific clauses minimum pse standards , 
 likely involve regular measurements consistent feedback producers . 
 example , swift’s 1998 contract , indication pse condition 
 measured procedures verifying compliance . aside lean 
 composition trim losses , pork quality data provided 
 packer back producer consistent basis (meisinger , 2000) . instead , pse 
 requirements may serve communication device express pse concerns 
 producer , perhaps signal customers packer efforts improve quality . 
 given difficulties measuring pse pork , strong incentives leanness provided 
 carcass pricing grids might expected divert producer effort away controlling 
 pse pork . clearly , packer’s ability control pse pork enhanced relationship 
 genetics hog production inputs . input specifications , together packer 
 monitoring , can give packers control pse-related attributes . 
 nearly 15 contracts contain terms related inputs affect pse . six

 strong incentives leanness efficient ? 
 discussed earlier , increasingly leaner , heavily muscled hogs often carriers 
 stress gene , linked pse pork . strong incentives leanness provided 
 carcass pricing grids expected packer can use marketing contracts 
 specify monitor producer behavior related important , difficult 
 measure attributes . given ability control pse attribute genetics 
 production management practices , clearly case . 
 strong incentives leaner hogs also efficient marginal benefits 
 packer relatively large compared marginal benefits reductions pse pork 
 (holmstrom milgrom , 1991) . marginal benefits producer efforts control 
 pse attributes may limited industry wide efforts breed stress 
 syndrome commercial herds (casau , 2003 ; marbery , 2000b) . 
 marginal benefits increasing leanness become relatively smaller compared 
 controlling pse attributes , weaker incentives , perhaps disincentives , leaner 
 hogs expected (holmstrom milgrom , 1991) . positive relationship 
 increasingly lean hogs pse pork (which disliked 
 packers / processors , distributors , consumers) . addition , researchers 
 believe fresh pork may become lean consumers (marbery , 2000c) . 
 excessive leanness one weakness identified 2002 pork quality audit us 
 packers accounting 64 percent hogs slaughtered (messenger , 2004a)[3] . 
 disincentives lean hogs reflected least one carcass pricing grid recently 
 submitted packer usda’s swine contract library[4] . grid demonstrated 
 slight cutoff lean premiums hogs exceeding 58 . 9 lean percent industry’s 
 common weight range , 232 292 pounds . 
 marketing contracts adjustments uncertainty 
 many contract clauses related production input requirements tend less detailed 
 regarding degree required inputs expected outputs fully specified . 
 rather specifically defining input standards , many clauses require 
 packer-approval feeding programs , facilities , genetics . excel’s contract , 
 example , specifications regarding diet , management , facilities , handling hogs 
 require inputs company approved , meet industry standards , minimize 
 carcass damage . provisions describe packer expectations plans working 
 together . stated one hormel’s contracts : 
 parties will work together assure genetics meeting production 
 carcass meat quality requirements . 
 less detailed nature terms may reflect uncertainty pork markets 
 make difficult packers accurately predict future input requirements . adapting 
 changing input requirements may facilitated recognizing potential areas 
 conflict advance , defining partner expectations plan collaboration , 
 rather defining specific terms cooperation . leaving contract terms less 
 explicit , transaction costs associated renegotiating revising contract terms 
 reduced light uncertain future needs . 
 changing industry standards pork products one source uncertainty 
 transaction . addition growing importance domestic fresh pork branding

 accurate measures pork quality can lead corresponding adjustments input 
 requirements pricing programs . examples late 1990s include ibp’s (now 
 tyson fresh meat) adoption ultrasound system measuring lean , 
 hormel’s autofom carcass testing system , also monitors pse-related indicators . 
 uncertainty related output input requirements reflected “adjustment 
 mechanisms” alter contract time . example , almost contracts specify 
 packer can change carcass pricing grid , requiring advanced notice 
 producer . 2000 contract , john morrell reserves right change add 
 additional requirements , upon reasonable notice , consistent evolving industry 
 standards quality . two swift’s contracts , require producers modify nutrition 
 plans requested (citing use non-genetically modified feed example) . 
 addition , requested company , producers must implement programs 
 improve quality company’s ability sell products (citing haccp 
 example) . terms help resolve coordination problems conflicts might 
 otherwise develop . 
 variation sample contract provisions 
 although many similarities input requirements monitoring clauses 
 across sample , also significant differences , even contracts offered 
 packer . may reflect differences type outlet targeted . 
 example , leanness , consistent color , water holding capacity important 
 pork destined grocery store shelves international markets compared 
 processing food service outlets (huskey , 2000) . 
 differences contract terms may also reflect changes information packer 
 goals time . ten contracts offered hormel , swift , john morrell allow 
 us observe contract terms time . splitting sample two time periods , 
 1996-1998 1999-2001 , provides five contracts period (table iv) . 
 comparing frequency counts across periods , three packers added clauses 
 required producers comply company haccp program , perhaps 
 anticipation farm-level haccp program . 
 clauses related handling hogs introduced first time latter 
 period . may reflect growing knowledge causes pse-related 
 attributes , greater concerns pse pork response increasingly leaner 
 stress-prone hogs . progress apparently made breeding stress 
 gene hog population , 2002 pork quality audit revealed increase 
 incidence pse pork compared 1992 . suggests handling problems may 
 important contributor pse-related problems[5] . 
 changes contract terms time also coincide attempts packers 
 expand offerings branded pork products . using two five-year time periods , 
 corresponding break contract analysis , compare number new 
 fresh pork products introduced hormel , john morrell , swift . 1999 2003 , 
 number new products tracked datamonitor increased markedly compared

 conclusion 
 us pork industry’s adoption marketing contracts offer several advantages light 
 changing emphasis pork quality attributes . long-term nature marketing 
 contracts limits number times producers must evaluate alternative 
 heterogeneous packer grading programs . minimum volume requirements allow packers 
 obtain larger number uniform hogs single source , measuring 
 provides reliable information quality rest . sample contracts 
 collected specific region usa provides insight design marketing 
 contracts . specifying production input requirements contracts , packers 
 maintain strong incentives easily measured leanness attribute , controlling 
 quality attributes difficult measure . quality 
 specifications production input requirements subject change , clauses 
 long-term marketing contracts define packer expectations plans 
 collaboration producers facilitate adaptation changes . coupled 
 production monitoring provisions , contract terms appear support effective 
 coordination timely responses changing input requirements . may 
 factors contributed growing use pork marketing contracts , changing 
 emphasis pork quality provided strong incentives increasing popularity . 
 sorting relative importance alternative market forces driving changes 
 vertical coordination us pork industry provides rich ground future research . 
 notes 
 1 . part livestock mandatory price reporting program , usda publishes 
 mandatory data contract arrangements , among data , protecting identity 
 reporting confidentiality specific transactions . 
 2 . packers typically hogs , provisions regarding production inputs 
 likely related hog quality outcomes rather efficiency gains lower production costs . 
 furthermore , one may argue input provisions less leanness attribute 
 strong explicit incentives lean carcass pricing program (smith , 1999) . 
 3 . study found bacon thin bellies , visually appealing consumers 
 less fat , less palatable (messenger , 2004b) . also causes processing problems related 
 yield losses slicing cook shrink . bacon-topped sandwiches became 
 popular restaurants , belly became increasingly valuable part hog .
