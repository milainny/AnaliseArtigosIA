 theoretical starting point reasoning 
 concept transaction cost economics (tce) . tce 
 focuses choice appropriate organisation 
 economic activities (in words : appropriate 
 governance structure) . starts observation 
 information complete per se 
 human capacity process information limited . 
 improving access processing information 
 related costs . consequence , human behaviour 
 guided rule satisficing rather optimising . 
 regard , tce roots like 
 scholars new institutional economics . people 
 intend act rational bounded 
 capacities thinking . economic actors hence take 
 decisions basis imperfect information (richter 
 furubotn , 1999 , p . 510) bounded rationality 
 (simon , 1957 , p . 198) . pure existence bounded 
 rationality imperfect information opens door 
 so-called opportunistic behaviour , rather euphe- 
 mistic term dishonesty , fraud malice (william- 
 son , 1987) . summarise , investment inevitably 
 related additional costs , so-called transaction 
 costs . transaction costs can take one two forms , 
 inputs resources margin buying 
 selling price commodity given market (stavins , 
 1995 , p . 134) . former direct costs carrying 
 transaction , . e . costs search , information 
 contracting , latter can regarded

 concept investment include transaction costs 
 part initial investment ee measure . 
 important concept tce notion 
 o . langniss , b . praetorius /investment specificity . investments can specific , . e . transferable another application . according 
 tce , specific investments allow efficient 
 production generic investments (williamson , 
 1987) . higher specificity investment 
 will efficiency gains occur specific 
 transaction . thus , specific investments characterised 
 quasi-rents , can derived invest- 
 ment comparison next profitable application . 
 example , insulation fixed 
 certain building , delivers energy savings 
 building user easily (if all) transferred 
 another building . thus loses initial 
 market value , asset owner depends sufficient 
 payments building user able recover 
 sunk costs realise quasi-rent specific 
 investment . investment highly specific 
 transaction energy service provider 
 building user . contrast , chp-plant 
 generic character since easily transferable 
 applications . 
 investments specific certain transaction thus open 
 door opportunism : quasi-rent risk 
 opportunistic behaviour transaction partner (a 
 customer , retailer , etc . ) . ‘‘partner’’ may threaten 
 refrain buying output investment 
 thus able appropriate least part quasi- 
 rent . anticipation danger , asset owner 
 incentive invest generic assets lower 
 quasi-rents risk possibly also lower efficiency . 2 
 alternatively , appropriate governance structure may 
 established safeguard quasi-rents specific 
 investments opportunistic behaviour (william-

 specific investment can realised , compara-

 conclude , extent specificity investments

 governance mechanisms . higher specificity 
 efficient governance will characterised 
 patterns hierarchies . hierarchies can take form 
 firm regulation . allow cooperative 
 intentional adaptations changes environment , 
 connected stricter accounting auditing 
 administrative controls , hence imply lower 
 incentive intensity . contrast , low specificity 
 investments allows pure governance markets 
 thus benefit theoretically optimal incentive

 important note , spite broad attention 
 renewable portfolio standards gathered 
 scientific political discussion , general trend 
 towards renewable portfolio standards can seen 
 emerge . countries still establishing new price 
 regulations (in europe , e . g . austria , france) others 
 postponed cancelled plans renewable 
 portfolio standards (in europe , e . g . austria , denmark

 investments solely undertaken supply certain 
 purchasers . example , manufacturer runs 
 factory supplies different goods number 
 customers , enhancement factory buildings 
 isolation low specificity rest 
 production equipment . contrast , enhancing 
 factory building , houses highly specific assets , 
 creates investment higher specificity . similar 
 conclusions apply efficiency improvements produc- 
 tion technologies energy supply technologies . 
 specific investments may also occur consequence 
 regulation : ee investments undertaken 
 fulfil specific regulatory obligation ; assets may 
 highly specific investment create 
 small benefits investor absence 
 respective regulation . 
 tce assumes higher specificity 
 asset , larger general opportunities raise 
 efficiency . reasoning assets 
 adapted specific purposes may driven 
 efficient . analogously , applies ee : ee potentials 
 can thus assumed largest highly specific 
 assets . also , higher targets reducing energy 
 consumption , specific ee investments 
 get . putting way round , early energy 
 savings may achieved less specific investments 
 ambitious ones . 
 finally , without appropriate governance structures 
 safeguard quasi-rents ee investments , 
 investments will take place . rents specific 
 investments risk governance based 
 pure , unregulated markets ; consequence , less ee 
 investments efficient ones will undertaken 
 compared situation regulation . thus , 
 opportunity costs occur , earlier defined 
 one type transaction costs , governance costs . 
 tce reasoning adds important explanatory (yet 
 similar) aspect existing discussion barriers 
 ee investments , focuses prohibitive effect 
 high upfront investments (vine et al . , 2003) 
 phenomenon short payback periods stipulated 
 investors ee measures (see decanio , 1993 ; blumstein 
 et al . , 1980 ; fisher rothkopf , 1989 ; koomey , 1990 ; 
 levine et al . , 1995 ; stern aronson , 1984 ; bhatta- 
 charjee et al . , 1993) . 
 however , far , arguments apply 
 commercial energy consumers . commercial energy 
 consumers consume energy accomplish business . 
 energy costs part overall production costs . 
 , private households consume energy part 
 overall final consumption . extra income 
 reduced energy costs acquired 
 transaction partner . threat losing 
 extra income search information costs 
 o . langniss , b . praetorius /detain households investing energy-efficientappliances . thus , ee investments may 
 analysed tce . 
 picture changes energy services tech- 
 nologies supplied rather pure energy . invest- 
 ments household sphere will make supply 
 energy service efficient . investments may 
 highly specific respect transaction 
 household energy service provider . 
 examples highly specific investment ee light 
 bulbs . albeit ee light bulbs can applied 
 generic (their value the next best 
 application) , energy service supplier’s costs 
 dispensing bulbs sunk costs . thus , part 
 investment entirely specific . another example 
 specific investments consultancy , needed 
 identify appropriate ee measures . standar- 
 dised analysis proposal formats help keep invest- 
 ments consultancy rather generic . however , 
 ambitious energy saving target requires individual 
 consultancy , thus raising specificity invest- 
 ment . 
 introducing energy service companies (escos) com- 
 mercial energy applications may reduce specificity 
 ee investments . take example consultancy , 
 costs gathering information to achieve 
 best ee may highly specific single consumer 
 energy . , esco might use gathered 
 information also customers thus 
 investment less specific . benefits economies 
 scale may thereby exceed far benefits 
 reduction specificity case . also 
 technical means reduce specificity ee investments , 
 e . g . movable chp plants . 
 summarise , analysis specificity ee 
 investments reveals higher ee target , 
 less appropriate pure governance markets will 
 . hierarchical governance allows specific 
 investments , preserves owner risk 
 sunk cost ; thus ee achievable . hierarchical (and 
 market) governance crucial secure transactions 
 parties investing ee 
 paying ee measures end . even 
 regulation creates market , actors 
 market will tend establish forms hybrid governance 
 elements hierarchy long-term 
 contracts . hybrid governance will soften 
 ongoing ‘‘high-powered incentives’’ (williamson , 1987 , 
 p . 90) act efficiently constituent pure 
 markets . escos may reduce specificity ee 
 investments search information . ee policy 
 thus targeted also establishing escos .

 gas emission reductions , related underlying

 third issue , directly related system

 narrow , energy savings may overstated . take 
 example total demand generation capacity

 generation plant capacity 100mw , 
 plant replaced efficient cogeneration plant 
 capacity 50mw , half demand will covered 
 generators outside system boundaries , regardless

 fourth crucial issue (and criterion) 
 practicality cost-effectiveness baseline metho- 
 dology . establishing relevant baseline 
 monitoring energy savings implies cost project 
 developer also government regulator .

 amount 5–10% project budget , 
 course depends many factors assumptions (vine 
 sathaye , 2000) . relative transaction costs even 
 higher case small-scale energy saving technol- 
 ogies private households (diw , 2003) . even 
 worse , case demand side management

 effects difficult calculate distinguish

 aspect discussed issue

 regarding system boundaries , mostly recom-

 however , long respective replacement invest-

 technology otherwise implemented . 
 regulator , appropriateness 
 individualised baseline approach via reference technol- 
 ogies chosen investor difficult assess , 
 information/transaction costs high . regulator 
 may therefore decide offer standardised approach . 
 example , certain performance benchmark 
 individual class appliances technologies

 technologies evaluated regard

 relative baselines performance benchmarks indicate

 argument benchmarks help avoid 
 uncertainties activity level project . 
 case , standardisation allows significant reduc- 
 tions related transaction cost . 
 last least , number less 
 practicable accurate monitoring methods 
 suggested (vine sathaye , 2000 , p . 200) . , , 
 standardised approach may ease supplemental 
 burden transaction cost . 
 major issue remains level transaction cost

 inaccuracy rough cost-saving meth- 
 ods . , probably necessary accept satisficing 
 description baseline define appropriate 
 control mechanisms (for example , comparison groups

 summarise , theoretical considerations 
 practical experiences show assessing success
