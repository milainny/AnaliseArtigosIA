 six aspects : 
  clarity roles objectives especially ministers 
 regulators avoid confusion functions carried 
 regulator carried ministry 
 (or bodies) , 
  autonomy political intervention will ensure 
 regulators independent . secure sources funding 
 3 electricity reforms , legislative executive institutions play initial 
 role producing reform law , always ‘‘incomplete’’ ; (i) 
 little knowledge technical economic issues stake 
 (ii) intervene frequently redefine rules necessary , 
 law needs sufficiently general flexible . see dubois (2009) details .

 (o¨zkıvrak dileyici , 2001) . state involved providing 
 almost every kind public private goods . 1980s , 
 government decided liberalize economy including electri- 
 city . privatization state-owned enterprises started 
 period . 8 
 electricity particular always important element 
 setting . domination sector state-owned enter- 
 prises ‘‘political good’’ nature electricity enabled politicians 
 use political maneuvering . 9 due three general 
 features utilities , including electricity : (i) specific sunk 
 investments , (ii) economies scale , (iii) massive consump- 
 tion . features incentivize government behave oppor- 
 tunistically expropriate investing company’s sunk assets 
 (spiller tommasi , 2005) . spiller martorell (1996) point 
 political instabilities always trigger government inter- 
 ference pricing investment policies sector . 
 since investments electricity provide benefits 
 future , current governments tend delay investments find 
 profitable subsidize constituencies directly 
 pricing . thus , country will relatively low 
 prices general residential prices will subsidized 
 particular . 
 moreover , governments turkey traditionally tended 
 use prices reduce inflationary expectations expense 
 larger future deficits , future deficits will taken care 
 future government whereas current inflation rates may 
 help current government . instance , brazil , argentina 
 uruguay , high inflation rates , 
 experienced similar manipulations governments well . 
 brazil argentina , real electricity prices fallen sharply 
 hyperinflation periods increased back later . 
 words , redistribution macroeconomic preferences 
 rather economic efficiency concerns determine prices 
 policies politically unstable countries (spiller 
 martorell , 1996) . turkey exception . 
 nonetheless , opportunistic behavior side 
 government sufficient explain overall picture , taking 
 consideration privatization attempts 1990s . 
 period , governments put lots efforts privatize state- 
 owned enterprises . 10 passed number legislation 
 privatization , failed meet legal economic 
 criteria set judiciary . atiyas (2009) argues laws 
 designed undertake privatizations quite unaccountable 
 non-transparent ways , looked shortcuts rather 
 create solid legal base proper privatization policy . 
 plausible explanation might politicians bureaucrats 
 lacked requisite capacity deal complexities 
 privatization consequences . long-term productivity issues 
 promotion competition usually dominated 
 fiscal considerations (such generating high revenues , reducing 
 public debt create flexibility current expenditures) . 
 fact , turkey suffered substantially imperfect 
 badly-designed privatization attempts sense 
 8 according privatization administration’s statistics , 188 
 enterprises amounting $39 . 6 billion fully privatized 
 1985 2010 . www . oib . gov . tr . 
 9 term ‘‘political good’’ due og˘uz (2010) . 
 10 fact different governments made similar attempts leastdemonstrates politicians privatization . government canceled privatizations . private parties headed 
 international arbitration . last arbitration case decided 
 2010 , except one , turkey lost cases . total 
 amount turkey pay private investors estimated 
 approximately $200 millions . high costs will borne 
 society rather governments charge back . 
 unstable political structure makes easier governments 
 externalize costs political actions . 
 recent example opportunistic government behavior 
 related natural gas prices . even though natural gas prices 
 increased substantially recent years , government kept 
 selling electricity (through state-owned companies) price 
 significantly marginal costs . 11 even though 
 government tries explain policy social grounds , 
 true since 61 . 7% demand industrial custo- 
 mers . practice pushed state-owned electricity gas 
 companies , also subject high gas prices , debt 
 chain (sevaiog˘lu , 2009) . predatory pricing also negatively 
 affected competitive market structure since deterred 
 private investors investing . 12 price mechanism used 
 politicians means transfer wealth different social 
 groups . 
 similarly , emra’s efforts introduce cost-based regional 
 pricing scheme 2003 hindered government (c- etin 
 og˘uz , 2007) . government’s scheme , end-use prices 
 uniform across country whereas costs supply vary 
 significantly across different regions . scheme negative 
 impacts private investment privatization processes , 
 since company like invest regions high costs . 
 cost-based regional pricing system solve problem ; 
 however , will result increased prices low income regions 
 (southeastern eastern anatolia regions) level illegal 
 use high . 13 instead adopting cost-based regional pricing 
 system , government preferred implement transitional 
 mechanism 2005 2010 prices remained 
 uniform regional cost differences minimized (iea 
 report , 2005) . period , illegal use regions 
 remained cross-subsidized consumers (c- etin 
 og˘uz , 2007) . 
 government eventually agreed adopt cost-based pricing 
 mechanism 2008 . decision inevitably led drastic prices 
 increases . 2 . 5 years , increases prices amounted 72% . 
 fact , positive climate conditions 2010 reduced costs 
 electricity government led expectations 
 cost reductions might reflected electricity prices (because 
 state-owned generation facilities hydroelectricity 
 power plants) . however , government disappointed market , 
 treasury needed financing rehabilitation 
 11 practice lasted government won elections 2007 . 
 electricity prices increased dramatically afterwards . 
 12 president electricity distribution services association reported 
 foreign investors pulled due possibility political intervention 
 prices . og˘uz (2010) , hand , argues difference rates 
 charged industrial residential customers fact lower difference 
 costs ; therefore , industrial customers subsidize residential ones .

 short , political concerns always forced governments 
 keep control electricity variables whereas efficiency issues 
 usually overlooked . current government exception . how- 
 ever , similar tendencies developing countries 
 already proved failure approach . countries like brazil , 
 argentina uruguay , public ownership , tariff 
 discrimination different users tariffs unrelated marginal 
 costs , failed whereas chilean electric system , 
 based competitive markets marginal cost pricing , turned 
 huge success (spiller martorell , 1996) . 
 addition government opportunism , social opposition 
 privatization considerable level . opposition may 
 explained traditional statist ideology , underlies coun- 
 try’s economic history . sevaiog˘lu (2009) argues statist 
 anti-liberalist social organizations exist even major 
 socialist countries . interview , head major energy 
 company counts statism one major obstacles potential 
 investors states idea maintain government authority 
 sectors strong (see gu¨ney , 2005) . north (1992) 
 argues larger number rule changes , greater 
 number losers opposition . labor unions strictly object 
 privatizations order protect positions . interests 
 usually aligned position extremely nationalistic political 
 parties , mainly concerned foreign investment energy 
 sector may threaten national security . nationalistic position 
 open manipulation anti-privatization interest groups

 positions , one government . governments 
 traditionally enjoyed liberty exercising wide 
 discretion energy variables political purposes , 
 negligence efficiency concerns . presence oppor-

 set forth council ministers . 
 4 . 2 . regulatory governance analysis emra 
 based regulatory governance criteria set forth stern 
 holder (1999) , section develops regulatory governance 
 analysis current regulatory practice emra , taking 
 account formal informal aspects regulation , 
 economic outcomes sector . 
 clarity roles objectives sufficiently pro- 
 vided market reforms . oecd report turkey’s energy 
 sector specifically points role involved parties 
 (i . e . government , regulator state companies) 
 determined clearly (iea report , 2005) . , indeed , related 
 two problems : (i) institutional diversity (ii) allocation 
 responsibilities among institutions . atiyas dutz 
 (2005) count least eight entities separate management 
 teams involved regulation process underline lack 
 coordination among . due highly dispersed regulatory 
 16 pursuant articles 123 127 turkish constitution , ‘‘unity 
 administration’’ principle applies . thus , especially cases independent 
 regulatory agencies , common practice ‘‘affiliate’’ agency aministry satisfy principle . 
 structure , allocation responsibilities costly overlapping 
 authorities inevitable . also , enough define 
 duties ministry regulator since government 
 additional tools influence sector . relevant laws 
 amended redefine institution’s role , 
 effective . interesting example electricity market law 
 limited authorities general directorate energy affairs 
 appointed council ministers . 19 fact , constitutional 
 court held similar case number board members 
 appointed council ministers may damage autonomous 
 structure authority . 20 line decision , current practice 
 may annulled constitutional court similar grounds . 
 also important emphasize time-periodic overlap : 
 emra established 2001 political party 
 charge since 2002 . means emra’s regulatory process 
 now almost entirely overseen political 
 party . 21 therefore , political preferences attitude towards 
 electricity market liberalization privatization 
 continuous consistent period . current composi- 
 s . mustafa durakog˘lu / energy policy 39 (2011) 5578–55875584to extent authorities left public 
 bodies (such emra) . apparently , legislature anticipated 
 possibility overlapping authorities ; however , instead clearly 
 defining , left vaguely open interpretation 
 political maneuvering . 
 fact , authorities many institutions 
 transferred emra subsequent establishment . estab- 
 lishment emra represents institutional change needs 
 treated accordingly . regulator place , scope 
 authority covers mostly many institutions 
 former structure ; thus , institutions longer needed . 
 instance , e_ie carries studies energy efficiency renew- 
 able energy issues . dpt advises government economic 
 policies prepares 5-year development plans cooperation 
 emra . 17 instead , structure proposed sector- 
 specific regulator better suited effective regulation 
 decision making well advising government 
 necessary lower cost . efficiency perspective , first 
 thing to reduce number institutions efficient 
 level responsibilities can allocated accordingly 
 clearly . system decrease decision making costs 
 information costs , especially avoiding duplication costs . 
 investors’ perspective , strengthen emra’s 
 authority market enable providing reliable regula- 
 tory commitment . clear allocation responsibilities also 
 contribute accountability predictability concerns . 
 , however , difficult dissolve long-established institutions 
 within state . hard imagine abolishing 
 institutions will face strong reactions , especially staff 
 will face threat unemployment . intermediate 
 solution integration suitable institutions emra . 
 emra may benefit integration terms synergy 
 gains well broad experience sector . 18 
 autonomy political intervention probably 
 significant aspect turkish case already men- 
 tioned politicians inveterate tradition using 
 electricity political purposes . therefore , correct choice 
 establish independent regulator ‘‘financial admin- 
 istrative’’ autonomy rather carry regulation 
 hierarchical structure ministry . however , order 
 evaluate degree autonomy emra , one needs put 
 positive negative aspects scale . 
 positive side , one mention following : emra 
 budget enjoys financial independence . emra 
 board decisions overturned government ; 
 decisions subject judicial review . also , board members 
 removed office government except inca- 
 pacity misbehavior . 
 however , lies negative side scale reduce 
 impacts positive ones . firstly , emra board members 
 17 dpt issued vital strategy paper concerning electricity 
 market reform privatization (2004) . 
 18 transfer transmission system network operation activities te_ias- 
 emra may also complementary step strengthen sector-specific 
 regulator position emra . particular importance turkish market 
 possibility political influence high development 
 consistent energy policy necessary . detailed analysis design oftransmission system operators , see rious et al . (2008) . tion emra board direct reflection problem . 
 entire board , including chairman , appointed 
 government . necessarily imply appoint- 
 ments made due political party affiliations . policy 
 preferences might carried weight well . however , 
 necessarily follows composition ‘‘agent 
 losses’’ will probably limited . principal—agent 
 terminology , problem agency losses arise agent 
 (regulator) acts contrary preferences principal 
 (government) . losses can arise two sources : either 
 ‘‘shirking’’ , agent follows preferences , 
 diverge principal’s , ‘‘slippage’’ , 
 incentives agent act contrary preferences 
 principal (thatcher , 2005) . current appointment frame- 
 work , agent losses will low , high possibility 
 board members will similar preferences 
 government . say ‘‘shirking’’ will low . addition , 
 institutional design incentivizes board members follow 
 preferences government , especially reappointment 
 concerns (thatcher , 2005) . namely , ‘‘slippage’’ will low well . 
 either case , current framework minimizes agency losses . 
 secondly , even though independent regulatory agen- 
 cies turkey audited court accounts , emra’s 
 budget supervised supreme audit board . court accounts 
 audits behalf legislature whereas supreme audit board 
 governmental body affiliated prime ministry . 
 mechanism provides government political tool 
 interfere emra’s internal affairs weakens emra’s position 
 government . constitutional court decision 
 (mentioned above) also rules supreme audit board 
 jurisdiction type agencies . thus , practice 
 may annulled unconstitutional . 
 third point , aslan (2007) points emra 
 defined ‘‘financial administrative autonomy’’ rather 
 simply ‘‘independent’’ . emphasizes considering emra 
 related menr , legally possible may take orders 
 menr within administrative hierarchy (aslan , 2007) . 
 empirical evidence also provides interesting results . s-anlısoy 
 o¨zcan (2006) apply independence index regulatory 
 agencies turkey find emra ranks last among peers . 22 
 19 aslan (2007) notes board designed indepen- 
 dent way first place , namely members nominated several 
 entities ; however , structure implemented . 
 20 constitutional court decision e . 2002 / 100 , k . 2004 / 109 , dated 21 september 
 2004 . 
 21 justice development party (akp) two single-party govern- 
 ments since 2002 , one current government . strong majority 
 parliament . 
 22 interesting point cross-country analysis , emra’s 
 independence index ranks higher electricity regulatory agencies many 
 developed countries including england , france , holland norway . similar 
 results , see ergu¨n (2007) . results can interpreted grounds 
 informal institutional structures matter formal ones turkey andcarry weight practice . 
 short , addition power government holds 
 various institutions regulatory process , current frame- 
 uncertainties market participants along transaction 
 information costs . 24 providing transparency also address 
 regulatory failures , regulatory capture bias towards 
 good ‘‘regulatory content’’ may introduced ; however , 
 s . mustafa durakog˘lu / energy policy 39 (2011) 5578–5587 5585work gives government direct control emra . enables 
 government play game traditional principal–agent frame- 
 work trivializes ‘‘autonomy’’ feature regulator . 
 accountability emra can controlled judicial review 
 turkey since neither government legislature entitled 
 review challenges emra board decisions . danıs-tay 
 competent court review filings emra . positive 
 feature , danıs-tay expertise sector 
 court first instance can handle cases lower cost . 
 system also enables unification judgments increases level 
 legal certainty (aslan , 2007) . moreover , danıs-tay reviews 
 filings urgent matter , avoids loss time . 
 participation relevant parties (regulated firms , consumers 
 sector participants) regulatory process may help 
 improve cooperation within sector , may legitimize 
 emra’s decisions sector participants’ eyes . positive point 
 emra obliged (and practice does) consult market 
 participants preparing regulations . however , actual 
 effects participation system ambiguous , 
 unknown whether emra actually takes account 
 suggestions consultations . effective solution 
 emra’s consultation responses can made 
 publicly available . system set right incentives 
 sides : incentivize market participants 
 express opinions proposed regulations since 
 higher chance making influence regulator . emra 
 also benefit active participation since system 
 allow emra learn preferences particular interest 
 groups foresee potential political problems may arise 
 advance (spiller tommasi , 2005) . , setting also 
 minimizes costs incurred legislature supervise emra 
 since legislature need actively involved 
 regulatory process used (spiller tommasi , 2005) . 
 concrete suggestion improve participation 
 establishment private sector consultation committee . 
 committee composed representatives sector 
 participants advisory role emra (oecd , 2002) . 
 close gap emra private sector 
 serve ex ante consultation information exchange forum . 
 effectively contribute reducing information asym- 
 metries parties . 
 transparency helps market participants better under- 
 standing emra’s approach certain issues well 
 decisions underlying rationale . emra legally 
 obliged publish decisions , significant obstacle 
 transparency . practice , emra voluntarily publishes 
 major decisions , informs market participants certain 
 issues whenever deems necessary . however , decisions 
 usually brief provide comprehensive information 
 regarding legal economic grounds based . 
 similarly , electricity market legislation constantly subject 
 change sufficient precedent rely upon concern- 
 ing emra interprets applies legislation . 
 increases costs transacting market participants , 
 information costly case , held asymmetri- 
 cally parties (north , 1992) . order avoid , emra 
 publish decisions , including legal economic 
 reasoning behind , comprehensive memoranda

 practice . albeit young , contributed significantly

 though analysis reveals mainly due government 
 behavior , emra can still improve regulatory methods 
 well . especially room improvement transparency 
 predictability issues . fact , emra currently involved 
 permanent institutional development strategic management

 critical negative aspect current structure

 government seems reluctant fasten liberalization

 24 common among energy lawyers turkey constantly call emra 
 officials learn interpret implement certain provisions , incertain parties (oecd , 2002) . 
 hand , noteworthy electricity market 
 licenses emra’s annual reports publicly available . 
 reports , emra legally obliged prepare 
 electricity security supply report electricity market

 cipants within reasonable time well . 
 predictability utmost importance country unstable 
 politics . electric companies undertake investments , need 
 recouped several years , need assured 
 reliable commitments will face sudden , unpredict- 
 able changes . uncertainty costly . emra better positioned 
 deal since clear governments fail 
 provide commitment political reasons . however , recent 
 report state audit board (2010) finds emra board 
 decisions tend differ similar circumstances lack con- 
 sistency . cure problem , emra can start publishing 
 annual regulatory plan , gives approximate list issues 
 dealt timetable (oecd , 2002) . may reduce 
 likelihood regulatory surprises , thereby minimizing 
 negative consequences asymmetric information costs 
 arising uncertainty . also transparency regulatory process , 
 mentioned , supports predictability sense market 
 participants will able observe emra’s approach certain 
 issues take consideration advance .

 (2007) also note many companies applied get govern- 
 ment subsidies ; however , start construction since 
 count government’s credibility commit- 
 ment . similarly , privatization electricity distribution 
 regions , scheduled completed 2006 , went 
 slowly anticipated deadline 
 extended end 2010 , investors happy 
 government’s pricing policies reluctant bid

 political uncertainty also played part , usual , 
 setting : constitutional court case concerning possible 
 closure justice development party (the current govern- 
 ment) negative implications entire economy . 
 problems opportunism lack commitment 
 concern current government . past governments 
 will future governments maximize 
 political gains . thus , turkey needs reform political 
 regulatory institutions provide reliable commitment 
 private sector . since political institutional change will 
 probably take long time , needs done short run 
 adapt regulatory institutions political realities 
 country . policies formulated backed 
 government emra hand-in-hand . day-to-day regulation 
 market must left solely regulator since better 
 suited provide regulatory commitment . private participation 
 competitive market structure will never reach desirable 
 levels unless opportunistic government behavior regulatory 
 commitment issues solved . 
 5 . conclusion 
 new institutional economics offers comprehensive 
 understanding regulation regulatory environments 
 significant contributions law politics . especially 
 developing country context , institutions institutional change 
 vital importance better economic performance turkey . 
 country unstable politics , high possibility variation 
 political structure provided room opportunistic 
 government behavior past . especially , develop- 
 ing countries , governments enjoyed liberty usingas principle , incentives subsidies investors 
 function extent credible (bergara et al . , 
 1998) . nature relationship private 
 investors government involves simple imbalance 
 investors obligation invest particular country 
 can always seek better opportunities whereas govern- 
 ment needs investment , especially foreign investors

 constraints arbitrary government action , possible 
 attract foreign investment exploit efficiency gains 
 competitive markets . electricity political purposes . economic efficiency concerns2 . fragmented institutional structure fixed . public 
 institutions lived lives need 
 abolished . overlaps authorities prevented 
 responsibilities allocated clearly . cooperation 
 promoted . ‘‘transaction cost reducing’’ approach 
 adopted general . 
 3 . institutional checks devised limit opportunistic 
 government behavior market . emra taken 
 direct political influence government , 
 government’s inherent power market super- 
 seded emra , better suited provide reliable 
 commitment investors . 
 4 . emra needs improve way regulates market . 
 room progress especially respect transparency , 
 participation predictability issues . 
 acknowledged market reforms intrinsi- 
 cally dynamic ; given complex nature , adapted 
 progressively long time efficiencies may arise 
 result learning process (dubois , 2009) . therefore , emra’s 
 efforts despite drawbacks structure must encouraged 
 sake long term benefits . last least , policy 
 makers keep mind single template 
 effective utility regulation . solutions regulatory problems 
 developing country like turkey may differ highly 
 developed country . therefore regulatory design must always take 
 account institutional endowments (constitutional , legal , 
 political , judicial , etc . ) , administrative capabilities 
 country . public policies intentionally recklessly con- 
 traboth government emra aware , general 
 regulatory principle , good regulatory content can 
 effective supported good regulatory govern- 
 ance , take basic fact consideration 
 every step policy-making . tionreforms will distorted , dissipated dissolved (north , 
 92) . exists clear cut policy can guide 
 licy-maker restructuring institutional change efforts . 
 vertheless , policy suggestions can still put forward 
 prove current regulatory structure . main policy implica- 
 s may summarized follows : sab 
 therth (1992) calls ‘‘dilemma institutional change’’ . rapid 
 nge will result social political turmoil since informal 
 straints underlying ideological perceptions will sim- 
 change . slow change , hand , will 
 otaged existing bureaucracy interest groups thatecohave usually overlooked sake macroeconomic 
 redistribution concerns . poorly designed privatization 
 attempts failed meet high legal economic standards 
 set judiciary , eventually resulted high costs . 
 moreover , social level , statist beliefs economic life deep- 
 rooted . 
 electricity market law 2001 failed bring 
 comprehensive institutional change structure . sufficient 
 institutional checks designed curb opportunistic 
 government behavior , emra left position 
 politically influenceable . moreover , old new public institu- 
 tions involved regulatory process overlapping authorities 
 conflicting interests turned regulatory arena 
 ‘‘regulatory / institutional chaos’’ . current structure highly 
 bureaucratic high number players de facto / de jure veto 
 powers poses high transaction costs well political 
 nomic risks investors .
